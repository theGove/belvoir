By the time I got to the room after walking down two long hallways at 9p, I didn't feel like going back to the clerk to ask for a room change so I stayed there for the next 4 days. In the bathroom, there was a splatter of what looked like toothpaste on the bathroom wall which was put there from a previous guest. I left it thinking housecleaning would take care of it the next day. But it wasn't taken care of. I wiped it off myself. On the second night I had a paper grocery bag with trash from my dinner . The bag was left open so it was obvious to see that it was trash, and placed next to the trash can. House keeping didn't pick it up. Lastly I used up the 2 packet of coffee grounds and by day 3 housekeeping hadn't restocked the coffee or the creamer. I had to call the front desk and wait for it to be delivered.

It was not a lot but JUST the fact that there was BLOOD on the wall completely freaked my out - AND grossed me out. I mean, if there is blood on the wall that NO ONE cleaned, then what else have they NOT cleaned. I get a second room. This room was still dirty - totally covered with food on the walls. Then to top it ALL off on my third (and last night) with the Belvoir, I had a HORRIBLE wake up at 11:30pm when security pounded on my door yelling "get up, who's in this room". Again I was SO freaked out. I didn't open the door but asked "why". All he said back was "call the front desk and tell them who's in the room". I was so confused because I had been in the room for two nights already. I called down and the front desk proceeded to tell me that my name 'wasn't' on a reservation' and therefore security was doing a check. WHY would they do this; a) at 11:30pm and WHY would they not have CALLED my room at an earlier time to verify!. Overall worst hotel experiences I've ever had. I will never stay there again and please know that I will be sharing this with my company who booked off the block of rooms.</td></tr>

The staff here go so far above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay so comfortable that you'll want to call this place home for longer than required. They deliver true and gracious HOSPITALITY, not just service. I have been blown away on so many occasions by the little (or big) extra lengths their staff here go to in ensuring expectations aren't just met but blown away that there is no way I could recount them all here. In short, I have stayed more than 700 nights in hotels spanning six continents in the last 3 years and the Belvoir Orlando North staff has done more to make each stay here memorable and remarkable than any other.</td></tr>

The sink leaked water, and the paint needed a touch up. The view was horrible. So after paying extra for a renovated room, I was very disappointed. The staff, however, was friendly and helpful. My husband and I were in town for the Margarito/ Cotto fight. We left our room and when we tried to open our door, the keys did not work. We were given new keys, and went on our way. The next day, we left for the fight and made sure our keys worked, which they did. When we arrived back to our room, very late, our keys did not work, again. We went downstairs, got new keys, informed the front desk this was the second time this had happened. We went to our room, which we couldn't get into because yet AGAIN our keys did not work. My husband went back downstairs to get new keys, which did not work either, so security had to come again.</td></tr>

This last visit I was initially given a room that smelled like an old gym locker and while I did get a parlor suite for the remainder of the week, it was a surprising showing from a hotel that has continually stated that they were working on resolving their overall issues. I will say that they are one of the few hotels I stay at that has a decent gym--amazing by hotel standards. I'm torn as to whether I'll stay here again and if business does take me back to New Jersey, I'll likely look to exhaust all other options before choosing to stay here again.</td></tr>

I stayed Thursday - Sunday. It was a very busy hotel, centrally located within walking distance to many places including shopping, a holiday parade, gingerbread holiday house, the famous Seattle Market, The Triple Door club, etc. We had a vehicle and the hotel is easily accessed from I-5 with no trouble at all. While the drive way can get busy at times, we ordered up our car with no problem during the busiest time of the day right after the end of the downtown parade and the staff was fast and professional. Our room was a corner room in the Union St tower ending in #51. It's has a bit more room that other standard room and due to the size of that tower, it seemed like a quieter portion of the hotel. We had access to the Club Room and it was well maintained, kept clean and well staffed. We used in mainly for breakfasts which were very crowded, but the staff working the room kept it clean, refreshed and moving. There was never a wait. We used the facilities including pool and workout room. The pool is a manageable size and our kids loved splashing around. It was loaded with kids over that weekend so it was pretty packed, but that is to be expected. We used room service and it was timely and correct. The housekeeping staff was exceptional and courteous. Jin was our floor's housekeeper and she was timely, kind and nice. I have stayed here many times and would recommend it for business and/or family stays. I will tell you that it is a very large hotel so if you are looking for a boutique hotel, this is not it. But for the competitive prices I paid for a large hotel it fulfilled all our needs.</td></tr>

I was attending a week long course at a nearby facility so the location was ideal for me. Winter Park and Altamonte Springs are within 10 minutes as well. The hotel is bigger than it looks. My room was on the 4th floor and was a hike to get too. However, it was a very comfortable and clean room. I would have expected the rate I paid to be much more for this room. The guidlines for writing a review forbids me to list the exact rate I paid, but tax incuded, it was under $100 per night for the standard 2 queen beds room. The room was dressed in a rich Mahogany wood decor with granite bathroom countertops. My bathroom was impecably clean, which is always a concern when traveling. The beds are very comfortable, but are a little noisy from the protective bed covering under the sheets. I know hotels want to protect the mattresses, but the covers are annoying. Also the air conditioner is a wall unit and is a bit loud (Just mildly loud) at night, if you need absolute quite to sleep. I was able to use the hotel computers for studying at night without any additional internet costs, which was nice. I thought the food on the hotel menu was considerably overpriced though. A $15 hamburger? That better be the best burger in Florida. All in all, the hotel is a great place to stay, especially for the price. I will definitely stay again if I am in this area overnight.</td></tr>

The last couple years the same bar tender is there and is always rude and this past year he got into an argument with a lady in a wheelchair and her husband. Plus I asked for one top shelf long island iced tea and he told me that it would cost me $30...needless to say I didn't drink a $30 drink. The drink I did get wasn't all that great.

I had to go around the room in the dark and plug everything in so I could turn everything on. Granted these are all little issues but not what I expected for a $160/night room.</td></tr>

But I find it a sticking point that pets could be in the lobby for check-in, and then are banished from "common areas". Yet they must use the hallway to get to the door to go out.... I am spoiled from other hotels, including Belvoirs, who welcome pets in the lobby area by the Link. Especially in the wee hours of the morning it isn't likely that a dog is going to be disturbing the majority of guests. Many of whom are happy to visit a pet. I also think charging about $18 for a movie that has come out on DVD is a bit over the top. People who are bothered by smoke should be aware that the outside door at the end of the room hallway has a large ashtray receptacle so that it draws some smokers and one has to walk by/through when following the dog rules to use that door for their walks. The room service rates are reasonable with access to a menu form their great restaurant. The rooms have fridges that don't seem to be cold enough to keep perishibles, thought I don't travel with a thermometer; and also have microwaves. At the end of the road (make a left out of the parking lot to the end, and then a quick right) is a Swensons's restaurant which has a nice variety of fast food, shakes, phosphates etc. Note if you don't like the sound of trains that you might prefer a non-river view. It is a lovely place to stay with very attentive staff and in general is very well maintained. I did note a sauce stain on the sofa, a stain on the carpet that i pointed out so my dog would not be accused, and the plug was missing from the bathub.</td></tr>

I have never had any hotel told me that I cannot leave my car outside for free when I check-in.

The security staff they have in place in front of the elevators is a joke they NEVER once asked anyone to show room keys. Anyone and everyone who wanted to come in off the street and enter the room elevators had unfettered access. Obviously, the location of the hotel is great and that is the only thing I can recommend about this hotel.

Arriving at the front desk, the lobby is very nice. The front desk staff was pretty incompetent; midway through check in she stops and tells me to hold on to help another customer who had forgotten to bring their credit card. A perfect example of what not to do in a customer service/ hospitality position. More on this later. The room decor was nice. Some peeling wallpaper here and there, which gives it a tackier/cheap feel than I would have expected, but overall nice and comfortable bed. Room service leaves a lot to be desired; my girlfriend has a dust allergy and was sneezing almost constantly. She is a barometer for airborne dust, and this place was full of it. Even if she wasn't allergic, if you could run your finger across the dresser and see the dust. What is the staff doing here? Obviously they're spending time in the room, but what are they even doing? I know this because a shirt was missing from our room. We found this out when turning in for bed, a pajama shirt was missing. An honest mistake on part of the staff, but what was the worst part was the customer service (or lack thereof). After calling the front desk, who seemed to totally not care and just wanted to wipe their hands of it, we filed a report with security. The security was helpful, a little smug. They told us to call before 6am on our checkout day. Why do we have to call? Why don't you call us? We called. We still don't have the shirt. Note this. The last straw is breakfast room service. Do not get this. We paid 60+ dollars for an Ihop style breakfast. Ihop in quality and size (if not smaller). Besides this, the form to order and put on your doorknob was highly misleading. If I check off one american breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, orange juice, and wheat toast, does that mean they send a serving of each of those to every person in the room? This is apparently how their minds work. THe breakfast was room temp at best. The staff called about 30 mins after delivering the breakfast to ask how it was. When I said it was cold i was met with a "I see....okay. hmm." Very helpful..why are you even calling me? I was expecting a lot from the Belvoir. I was disappointed on almost every level. The staff is incompetent, not very helpful or caring. When I went downstairs to purchase something from the grab and go snacks, I get a big earful of a graphic and violent conversation between a front desk staff (male) and a kitchen worker who appeared to be leaving for the day. Food is overpriced. Location is fine. I just expected so much more. When staying at a Grandbourne establishment you expect your visit to be easy and comfortable. This one has a lot to work on. Keep this in mind when choosing this hotel. It definitely was the low point of my weekend visit unfortunately.</td></tr>

The hotel is great in terms of location, right in the middle of everything and easy to get around especially with great help from the Concierge. However, a potentially excellent stay was marred by exceedingly poor sound insulation in the rooms. The noise between rooms is so bad, you may was well do away with the walls and have everyone sleep in the conference centre. On two nights we had shouting and general conversation going on in both adjoinging rooms in the early hours of the morning (3am.) Also loud shouting in the corridors and banging on doors. I accept that this is outside of the control of the hotel, but expected that on the club floor of the hotel that this would not be as bad. The sound proofing in the rooms (considering they are newly renovated) is unacceptable. I am a platinum card holder with Grandbourne so travel very frequently and this exceeds any experience I have had anywhere in the world by quite some margin! There was no way to discuss this with any senior management at the hotel while we were there was no-one visible anywhere to discuss this with. Great visit never the less, great location but something needs to be done about the room noise</td></tr>

The rooms on the executive level are basic, small and no frills. Although advertised to have water bottles, the entire 3 day stay no waters were to be seen. The rooms on the executive floors were small and certainly not worth the $500+ per day that they charge. The club lounge was always crowded, the hotel operator, concierge or guest services operator had long waits to answer and one would eventully hang up because of the long wait. No one ever apologized for anything that went wrong. By the way the pool and spa are in a hotel across the street, so if you work out in their fitness center (it was nice) you have to get dressed and go across the street if you want to swim or take in a sauna after your work out. went to look at it and it was dirty and old. It was like the staff was doing the guest a favor for staying there and no one ever said "How may I help you". This hotel does not deserve to be a member of the BPG family. As a frequent traveler and a soon to be Platinum member of BPG, the company should be embarrased to have this hotel as part of its offering of properties. The ENTIRE staff needs to be trained on customer service and hospitality services. This was 2 stays in one, first and last, at this hotel</td></tr>

The man that works in the Club Lounge (I wish I could remember his name - I think he said he was employee of the year last year) is SOOOO friendly and helpful.

After checking in we went to the room and were impressed with the view and location. What we did note was that the carpets were not vaccumed and there was a HUGE cobweb over one of the beds. My husband travels for work a lot and we are used to staying in Grandbourne resorts, so we were a little taken aback by this. We found the room to be comfy, but did not sleep much due to doors slamming at all hours of the night and early morning. We found the doors to be very difficult to close properly and others probably found the same issue. The staff members were amazing, especially the ones in the Daisy's Garden gift shop. We stayed for a total of five days and that cob web was still there to wave goodbye to us when we left, as well as the crumbs on the floor that were there when we checked in. That floor had not been vaccumed the whole time we were there!</td></tr>

Handicapped Parking had such few spaces close to the entrance we rarely found a spot in the first parking lot. At times we tried to park in the second lot without success as well - during convention was impossible to find any parking place let alone a Handicap spot...making it EXTREMELY difficult to get inside hotel with a Disability. Hard to swallow a $11 per day parking charge when it is so unaccessable. The room key card lost it's magnetic functions approx. a dozen times which made us have to take a dozen trips down to the front desk to be able to get into our room - it also stopped working for us to get in and out of the parking lot and needless to say was extra difficult with a walking disability to continue to make unwanted trips to the front desk. Opted out of the room-service to gain daily $5 vouchers for the restaurants and had to request 2 separate days due to NOT receiving them as promised. On our 4th day, our room was NOT cleaned as indicated it would be. At the end of our stay, we were incorrectly billed for restaurant/lounge charges that were not ours - the front desk did correct their mistake after I requested they get copies of the receipt and they could not locate the hard copies. The hotel itself is very beautiful; however the hardships of this trip cannot allow me to recommend this resort. Unfortunately, Disney was not my favorite place on earth during this last visit.</td></tr>

The work out room was very impressive with everything needed to stay in shape. The weather in Florida this time of year is PERFECT. I rented a bike ($15 dollars a day) for exercise and to take in all the sites Fort Lauderdale has to offer. A bike is a good way to get around in Fort Lauderdale.

I use the computer and other amenities in the Club Level area for work. To do the work in the room (without my laptop) or the Link is not the reason why I come to The Parsippany Belvoir. The hotel should have set up an alternative location as did the Miami Airport Belvoir when I visited Miami in October. I'm sure an alternate location could have be made or platinum members or those who whish to upgrade to Club Level. This is why I am disappointed in the experience. When I asked as to the length of the Club Level being closed I was surprised to hear it would be until mid-January.

Additionally, when I checked out, I left a phone in the room and called the hotel promptly to see if they found it. They told me they would have to check with house keeping and would get back to me. I did not receive a call back, so I stopped by the hotel. I spoke with the manager and gave him all of my contact information as well as the information on the phone. He promised I would receive a call back the next day, but again, I did not. I called back on the third day and was told, "we haven't found any phones." There was no apology or any sort of empathy. Again, knowing that I left the phone in the room makes me highly suspicious that it did not turn up. I will not stay at this hotel again. This was my second visit to this hotel and my second issue. My previous visit, first, they checked me into a room that wreaked of smoke, in a non-smoking hotel. There is no way a cleaning person could not have noticed that this room smelled of smoke. Then, I had been told that the hotel bar got the NFL Network, which was important to me because I wanted to watch the 49ers game on Thanksgiving Night. Returning to the hotel, I found out that I was lied to and had to scramble to find a bar open on Thanksgiving night showing the game.</td></tr>

My 6 year old daughter was pushed over and trampled twice in our effort to get on a shuttle. We waited in line, and others pushed us. My daughter in the stroller was tripped over as well. When I went to the front desk at the hotel, Len the assistant manager, kept me there for over 30 minutes but did NOTHING! He blamed Disneyland for the problem, but would not offer any hotel responsibility, and was not concerned that my daughter was trampled by his guests. THe shuttle is free, but you are on your own for safety. The hotel takes no responsibility.</td></tr>

Our stay was extremely relaxing despite the hotel being sold out. I thought the staff undersold our "pool view room" as the pool we looked at was parallel to the ocean in the "cabana" section of the hotel (it's only a few stories high). As a platinum member, I was given coupons for breakfast (you can either get the buffet or order off the menu). With the parking pass, there is a 10 or 15 percent off coupon for lunch or dinner for all guests. We found the valet to be extremely friendly; self-parking is somewhat limited, but valet is affordable.</td></tr>

I have stayed here 3 times for 1 night at a time and it seems that is the optimal length of stay for satisfaction. Of the 3 rooms on 12/25 the bathroomwas not cleaned in one, another was not cleaned until the late evening after calling housekeeping and the third wasnt cleaned at all, sheets werent cleaned and whe asked to clean the linen was told that nobody at the hotel knew how to differentiate between king and queen sheets. When the housekeeping woman was called at her home, she gave the info to a maintanence person on staff who simply brought the sheets to the room as he had no idea how to put them on. I was/am extremely dissapointed and embarrased by the situation as I encouraged my family to stay here and I touted how great this particular Belvoir was as a proud Grandbourne platinum guest. I realize with the holiday maybe the staff was short but thats no excuse for such terrible cleaning and service as the rate was no cheaper than any other. I hope the issues behind this can be corrected. I would like to nite that i did have very positive interactions with the bartenders at shulas on both the night of 12/23 and 12/24. As well, the restaurant manager on duty the morning of 12/26 and the exec sous chef who took over omlette duties were extremely helpful to myself and my family. I hope my comments are constructive and i wish you an enjoyable new year.</td></tr>

However, my satisfaction ends there. In the Gold/Platinum check in line the representative was clueless about any features of the hotel, and unable to answer any questions. It took approximately 20 minutes to get us checked in, with no special requests other than asking about upgrade availability. Second point, there is 0 Platinum recognition at this property. While the room might be slightly better than the base room, it is not an upgrade by any means. In addition, the only Platinum perk is they waive the resort charge. Two points on this...first, everything in the resort charge is provided free to Platinum's by every other property already, and second, I found out during our trip that the 3 other parties we were traveling with all had the resort charge waived as well, "for being valued BPG members". These parties were all preferred members only with no status in the program. Next, food is horribly overpriced throughout the property. I am familiar with hotel /resort food being at a premium, but it is taken to a new level here. The quick service cafeteria, Picabu, is extremely slow to make the situation worse. Lastly, the room was what I would consider moderately clean throughout the stay. While not poor, it was not great either. However, there was a mild smell in the room that we could not identify (in their defense I did not ask about either). On the last morning, we were looking under the beds when packing and found a paper coffee cup filled that was slowly leaking and also molded. It had at least been there for several nights before we arrived. This was not far under the bed, but right at the edge where someone pushing a vacuum would have hit, or casually looking under would have found it. So while the room presented okay, I have serious concerns about the details in the cleaning.</td></tr>

The view from our room overlooking Logan Circle was spectacular and if you have never slept in a Belvoir bed, put it on your to-do-list! Our stay was made even more memorable on the night of my milestone birthday. We returned to our room from dinner to find chilled wine, cheese and crackers with a "Happy Birthday" greeting personally signed by each and every front desk staff member. WOW This staff is professional, caring and so friendly. They turned our get-away into a truly memorable experience.</td></tr>

Hotel itself was super comfortable; great beds, excellent workspace/desk and chair, new HD TVs, good shower and bathroom.
