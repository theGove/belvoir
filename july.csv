The front desk staff (especially Mariana) was great. The pool(s) and layout were great. We stayed in the Marina tower and had two rooms for our stay. If you charter a boat check out the Sweet Angel.

We had some housekeeping issues we discovered upon check in. We asked to have them fixed and were disappointed to find they were not taken care of.Not what I am use to in a Belvoir propery. After speaking to another manager, things were taken care of. I'd say the cleanliness overall was a bit of a let down (dusty corners, dirty glasses, toenail on the floor) . But after they fixed the issues, our stay was great. The staff is friendly and polite. The hotel is perfectly situated in the downtown core so you can reach everything. Overall it ended up being a wonderful stay and we'd definitely stay here again."

Lovely beds, view, bathroom and color scheme, however the walls are thin and both our neighbours had children. The lobby was a screaming mess of young teenagers on a NY trip, I counted to at least three different groups and needless to say the few computers in the lobby were always busy. I met a man who had been put on a floor with one such group and he described his floor as ""a carneval"" and had been granted a switch of floors. The staff in general don't know how to smile and with the exception of the staff at the tickets & tours counter all other treat you as a trial put on them. Since this was our first trip to NY and the choices outside were overwhelming we tried to get tips on good eating places and other things. After a few attempts we realized why there never was a line-up. Also, this is the ONLY hotel ever that has charged me for storing my bags for a few hours between check-out and leaving for the airport.

That didn't happen here. The man who cleaned my room was Alex. I only know this because he hand wrote a nice welcome note after my first night there. He replaced what needed to be replaced and left what I wanted them to leave. I have never understood why some hotels change your sheets every night even though I didn't put the card out. It was beastly hot in NY when I was there and the AC worked great in spite of my window facing into the sun. By NY standards, both the sleeping area and the bathroom were spacious.

It is a well kept hotel. The ambience and facilities exceed that of most Belvoir properties. The staff is also exceptional. Front desk, valet, and wait staff are all friendly and professional. We have enjoyed this property many, many times and continue to choose it when visiting Kansas City. However, we will look elsewhere for our next visit. We arrived to a completely full hotel (based on adjoining convention center event - so call ahead and check). This meant that a very simple request, adjoining rooms, was not met. As a platinum member, I expect a reservation request made months in advance to be met. When traveling with our children, we want adjoining rooms. An upgrade is always nice, but adjoining rooms are essential. When we asked for a rollaway bed, we were told they were all taken, but we could have an air mattress. The air mattress was deflated by the morning. We were told we could move to adjoining rooms the next day. That was reasonable and we thought one night with full occupancy meant we could overlook the negatives of the first night. The next day, we were told by several staff members that the hotel was going to be so empty, that they were only using a few floors. What that meant was that we did indeed get adjoining rooms, but we were next to a barking dog and surrounded by slamming doors, and directly across from an ice machine that was used throughout the night. It also meant that the restaurant, which we really enjoy was closed for dinner one night. It also meant that there was construction noise in many areas. Apparently, when hotels are low occupancy, many projects are completed. The bottom line is that this is a great hotel. It is well kept. It is also staffed with friendly and professional people. However, call in advance and find out about occupancy! Too full and customer service and guest loyalty are not met. Too empty...you might regret the choice. I've had several great stays here, this one was well below my expectations."

This meant that none of my relatives who booked rooms were given the ""complimentary breakfast, afternoon hors doeuvres and a variety of beverage options"". I was horribly embarrassed that my wedding invitations mentioned features that were only given to guests if they paid for suites. It wasn't clear enough on the website or in my communications with the hotel rep. When I spoke with the hotel staff about it the night of my arrival, they wouldnt offer anything other than that guests could pay the additional cost for the club level, meaning they would have to pay $30 more per room, would still have their regular rooms but could then have access to the 5th floor for the complimentary items. I also thought a ""block of rooms"" meant everyone would be on the same floor and had planned on everyone joining me while my hair and makeup was done in my suite on the wedding morning, however, I was on the 5th floor and everyone else was on the 3rd or 4th and the elevators didn't allow guests to go further than the floor that their room was on. Those without a room key couldn't use the elevator at all so when my stylist arrived and then later the photographer, I had to go down and get them (even though I was busy with other things). Then I had to have someone go down to the other floors with my room key every time a family member was ready to come up to my room, so my phone was ringing nonstop. It was a huge hassle and I very much regretted choosing Belvoir during both nights of my stay. Also, the shuttle that I arranged to come pick up guests from the venue at midnight went to the front entrance, but everyone was expecting it at the back entrance (where it had earlier dropped them off), so everyone missed the midnight shuttle and had to wait outside for almost an hour for it to come back. This was all extra stress that I did NOT need on my wedding weekend."

The trash was not emptied daily even when overflowing. The coffee and tea were not replenished unless specifically requested. The housekeeping was not what I would expect from a Belvoir. They just did the least amount possible that they could get away with. They even fought with us when we asked for an additional comforter giving us the third degree about why we needed one and what we were going to use it for. We brought the issues to the attention of the housekeeping managers who apologized but the fact that the room was not cleaned daily makes me question returning to this hotel the next time we are in NYC. The housekeeping service was not what one expects from a Belvoir hotel and certainly detracted from our stay.

The cleaning staff ignored our requests and the people up front at the desk gave the appearance of caring but had no followup on the room. Prices were comparable to other hotels.

After crawling around to seeing if I could find connection problems (unsuccessfully), I decided to call the desk or housekeeping to report the problem. The phone was also not working! By them I had to depart for an appointment and reported the problems to the front desk. By the time I returned late that evening, the problems had been solved. The next morning, I went down to the hotel exercise facility (it is great!) and after the workout I found that my room key would not permit access to the 15th floor (my room was 1566). I went to the desk and was told that the magnetic striip was the likely problem and a new key was made. HOWEVER, since I did not take ID with me to the gym, I had to wait for security reasons to be escorted to my room. The desk clerk called for assistance and I/we waited a full ten minutes or more before someone finally responded. Once we got to the room, he just opened the door and let me in without any check of credentials so I don't see the point of a security escort. The upshot was that I was late for my first appointment that morning. This was unusual because I've always been very satisified with my Grandbourne experiences, but this was definitely a disappointment."

Food price at the Cabanas has increased though not necessarily better quality.,2,5 stars if not for Aqua Vi,"This was our 4th consecutive visits in as many years. The staff are courteous as always. The updated room gives a more ""clean"" feel. The pool is narrow; we much prefer the former meandering pool, though the covered pavilion provides shades for those not wishing to be in the sun - something lacking previously. The main disappointment and dark spot of this stay was our experience with breakfast at Aqua Vi. We (party of 3 adults and 2 children) were made to wait about 40-45 minutes before we were seated. I noticed quite a few people arriving after us were seated before us. I enquired with the hostess and was told they are part of a wedding party of 25 who had reservation and that we will have a table soon. Fine. Meanwhile, the waiting room was cleared and only a few guest waiting. There comes a family of 4, unrelated to the wedding party, and they were seated within 5 minutes wait. Another family of 4 were seated right away upon arrival. I enquired again and complained. The hostess mentioned that she did not know that my party included 2 children. This is not good an explanation. COMMON SENSE should have prevailed that we have been waiting for 3/4 hour already and hence that everything should be done to accommodate our group, either to add another chair to a table or to join 2 tables together. But it never occurred to the hostess that there should be some parity and fairness, its 45 minutes versus 0 wait just because of 1 person. I wondered whether she would have kept us waiting had another family of 4 appeared, and until a table of ""5"" is freed. In the end, we were given a booth which is not even for 5 as one had to move out of the seat for the person inside to come out. I would not have cared for this had we been seated in the appropriate waiting time. I hope our situation is not repeated and that the hostess will look outside of the box."

We discovered this on the day we checked out and received our bill.The entire hotel desperately needs updating. Our room was on the pool level with a pool view. Every time a guest moved a chair at the pool it was extremely loud in our room. The room was warm and even though we adjusted the air it did not cool down. We asked for a 7:45 wake up call on the morning of the funeral but instead received a 5:45 wake up call. We then had to call back again to request another wake up call so that we wouldn't oversleep. The following morning we wanted to sleep in because we were exhausted so we did not request a wake up call but received one at 7:45 and could not go back to sleep. The pool was absolutely disgusting. The color was off, you could not see the bottom of the pool and there was hair all in the pool. There was nothing ""nice"" about the pool area either, only the view. You could hear a lot of hall noise in our room. The bathroom layout was small and the toilet is literally underneath the counter. Awful hotel and WAY over priced.

This went on from 9:30 pm to 11:45. Needless to say we couldn't sleep - and it sure wasn't romantic. We called the desk and complained. They said it would be ending at 11 pm (not true) and said they'd have security quiet it down (didn't happen - it got even louder). The next morning we complained about this. The front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. They were apologetic, knew about the problem, offered to buy us breakfast, gave us Grandbourne points, etc. There can always be a problem, but if the management accepts responsibility and makes it up to you - that really saves the day.

They have done an excellent job with this place and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the area. I was greeted immediately by Matt at the front desk when I arrived. His service was well beyond anything you'd expect in a chain hotel. All of my requests were met with a smile including an early morning check-in due to delayed flights from Dallas. The suite I stayed in was great, nice leather sofa, new TV's and very comfy beds. They have done great things with the lobby restaurant and bar area which welcomes everyone as they arrive.

We have stayed in this resort a couple of times and are Grandbourne Preferred Guests. As we walked into our room, we were greeted with a garbage full of beer bottles, a kitchen full of dirty dishes and the refrigerator wide open. It looked like the room had never been cleaned, and that a party had just recently ended. We made our way to the master bedroom to find a bed that looked like it was just laid in, and a bathroom with towels all over the floor, and all the complimentary soaps opened and used. The second bedroom was suppose to be two DOUBLE beds, and to our surprise was two TWIN beds, mind you we were four couples. What I found a little comical of all of this is that we called around 6:00pm to say we were running late and wouldn't be in until 11:00pm , and we were told your room is already clean and ready. I guess the Belvoir has different opinions of what constitute a CLEAN and READY room. We called management and were told someone would be right over, it took about 40 minutes for someone to come, this was already 1:00am. The supervisor didn't even bother looking at the condition of the room and simply stated he believed us, which leads me to believe this isn't the first time the Resort encounters this problem with a guest. They moved us to another room, and we were told that we would receive a $40 credit to use in the resort for our stay. When we got to the other room, again we were greeted with unmade beds, at this point we were tired and just wanted to sleep, so we just asked for clean sheets, the supervisors response was ""look in the closet"", clean sheets were never brought to us. We decided to go and use our $40.00 credit at the supermarket located inside the resort, much to our surprise, there was NO CREDIT TO USE! the overnight supervisor never notated the account with the credit, and forgot to mention why we requested a room change. We decided that we had enough of the resort and went to the front desk to ask for a credit of $40.00 back to our credit card. Again, we were greeted by unfriendly staff, unwilling to help. We were told that they could not do anything for us and that a credit to our account was illegal, mind you we reserved our stay directly with the hotel, I would understand if we booked with a third party. After about an hour of arguing with management we were given a $40.00 credit towards our credit card. I am sorry, but after all the problems we had with the resort, I sincerely though management would have offered a little more then the initial $40.00 credit were we offered for a DIRTY, UNKEPT, SMELLY, room and UNFRIENDLY, UNHELPFUL employees. I visit Orlando on a constant basis and have stayed at the Belvoir several times. Unfortunately our next stay in Orlando will NOT be at the Belvoir Vistana Resort. This is not the service you expect from such a large hotel chain, it's not like we paid $40 a night, we paid $212 a night (with taxes) for horrible service, and an initial dirty, unkept, smelly room, with dirty sheets. I would never recommend this resort to a family member, friend, colleague, or random passer by. This was the worst hotel experience my family and I have ever had."

After a day of delays we arrived at the hotel at 9 p.m. (in my mind I was thinking all we need to do is take a shower and hurry up to make it to our event) and the hotel staff tells me the hotel is overbooked and there is no room for us. Their alternative is to send us to another hotel 15 miles away in La Jolla. By the time we got to the other hotel and checked in it was past 11 p.m. The whole point of us going to San Diego was to enjoy and have fun . This experience was anything but that. The hotel overbooks and we end up losing. We didn't make it to our event that night because it was a 30 minute taxi ride back to San Diego and another 30 minute taxi ride back to the hotel. We ended up calling it a night after realizing that by the time we would get back to San Diego we would be to late for our event. This disrupted our travel plans and made us miss the reason we were going to San Diego. This is unprofessional and should not happen.

We ordered food three times during our stay and every meal was very good. We were also pleasantly surprised with the entertainment options for both kids and adults - the movie by the pool at night was a great touch. But there were two things we felt really detracted from the ""upgraded"" persona of this hotel -- #1: While the staff were always friendly and happy to help, there were just too few working the pool bar. Every time we went for a drink or to place a food order, it was a long wait and they just seemed to be always running around. And getting anyone to take your order while lounging at the pool was an impossibility - a real challenge for parents with two small children. Secondly, while the idea of the poolside movie after dark is great, we think the hotel really should have invested in double paned windows for the pool facing rooms.

We stayed in an ocean view suite that was clean, comfortable and spacious. The front desk staff was very courteous and helpful. Christopher at the pool was very friendly and fun to talk to. Our service at the bar, pool and restaurant was great, too. The grounds were nice but not overly clean. I wouldn't say dirty, but I didn't notice much attention to detail, i.e. cigarettes, leaves, etc. The pool was very nice and very family friendly. We've been to a lot of places with our kids and it seems there's often pool police yelling at people for having fun. Here, everyone was having fun in a safe and controlled way. I saw Christopher address 2 guests very discreetly, one for smoking a cigarette and one for drinking what was presumably her own alcoholic concoction out of a red cup. He simply asked her to put it in a clear cup from the bar. Very reasonable! The shuttle worked well for us but I overheard a lot of complaints. You are required to book early and if it books up you are out of luck. The van only seats around 12 people. It seems like they could have either more vans or a larger bus-type vehicle. Ed was a great driver. He was very fun to talk to and helpful with suggestions and directions. I would definitely recommend this property. We will be bringing our kids back next spring."

Upon arriving we were incredibly excited and shocked to see how nice this resort was. It is beautiful and very well maintained. We checked-in in about 5 minutes and were led to the concierge who was amazing. She gave us basic welcome information, some coupons for local restaurants and a sheet for all the times for the shuttle to Disney World. The next morning we arrived to wait for the shuttle with about 20 other people. However, the shuttle was over 20 minutes late picking us up. They said it was a fluke so we ignored it and had a great day at Magic Kingdom. That night, we went to the bus stop to be picked up by the bus to get back to the hotel. This time, the bus was over 30 minutes late. We got back to the hotel and I decided to call and ask if there were any other ways of getting to Disney besides the bus since we were only in Orlando for Disney. When I called, the lady very rudely told me that no one ever complains about the bus, and that the only other way to get to Disney would be a Taxi and that would be very expensive. She then said the bus was always on time. The bus was late every evening picking us up, at least by 15 minutes. One time, it even came to the wrong bus stop and almost left 20 people stranded at Disney World. I know this sounds like a review for the bus service, but the Belvoir hires them and refuses to help fix it. We left a message with the Manager so hopefully it will be fixed in the future. But after this experience, we won't be staying here again."

Especially with it being a junior suite the table looked as if of was gotten from the dumpster and oh yeah there was an old blood stain on the coverlet on the bed. We also requested a rollaway bed and this room had a dbl pull out sofa as well and there were no bedding items for this in our room and when the lady came to drop of the bedding she was rude and said did you even check the closet ... Of course I checked the closet ... Don't recommend this to anyone save your money and points. You are better off paying to stay elsewhere.

All good. We had breakfast on Sunday and went up all day trying to get a coffee, water, snack and there were none to be had. We started lookin at 10:30 pm and at 3:00 pm I went to the front desk to inquire. They told me that snacks were placed out after breakfast and then no one came back on until the cocktail hour. I told them that I couldn't even get a cup of coffee and it said snacks were provided all day. They told me it had been very busy and food would arrive at the cocktail hour. Now the same snacks that had been there the day before were being sold to a dance competition. I suspect they were using the product from the concierge for that. I was pretty much dismissed. I do know that the employee that was working the room the most had to cover another employees schedule because they had called in. I spent in total $90 and only had one day where the food and drinks were availible to me. I came in on Friday around 10 pm and and left on Monday. It was disappointing."

There was a lot of coming and going that was quite audible in the room. It should also be noted that rooms on this side of the first floor are bi-level rooms. Enter on one level with closet and bathroom and then descend 5 steps to the bed area. While it make for a bigger room - mostly because of tall ceilings - the arrangement of the furniture that would have been fine for a normal sized room -seemed a little lost in this space. The plus side of this room was the patio outside that was great for coffee in the AM. Because of the larger size of the room, the AC (which could not be set below 70) could not really keep up with the heat and cycled on and off on a regular basis. Despite these points, I would stay here again just not on this floor."

I was offered a room with a sleeper sofa or a king bed. As I was travelling with another woman, we wanted two beds but had to settle for a king bed the first night before we could get a room with two beds for the rest of our stay. The front desk staff was unapologetic and unhelpful. No offer of compensation was offered and I had to argue to get a $50 room credit. The next night we found a soiled bandaid stuck to the blanket on one of the beds and it took the housekeeping staff 45 minutes to come change the bed."

The rooms are small and not overly modern or clean. It can be difficult to get a room with two double beds if you need to sleep more people. If you do, the rooms are very small for three or more people to stay in. The check-in lines are long and slow. What takes them so long to check people in? Seems like they are doing all kinds of typing and clicking and looking and searching and whatever it is they are doing. Should be easier and simple. I stood in a line of about 10 people checking in and had to wait over 20 minutes before I got to the front of the line. Luckily, I got there when I did as a bunch of people showed up after me and waited way longer. There was only three people working check-in and one guy in the corner working on a computer but not helping anyone. People in line were not very happy. The best part of the hotel is location, especially if you are going to the Times Square area. It is easy to get to lots of places from here walking. Easy to get a cab and friendly doormen. I stay here only when I need to be close to Times Square. Otherwise, there are way better choices. Oh, and no free wifi. What are they thinking? Just makes people mad."
