For the star rating and listed price, didn't expect paper cups, dinged up furniture and 80s beige theme. The air in the hotel was stale, and my wife in I took deep breaths of relief when outside, which is saying something in Pittsburgh. Biggest complaints: 1) Room heater was wildly erratic,and more like what I would expect in a cheap motel. Room was cool but turning up heat to highest setting only brought up heat a few degrees, over several hours. Turned it down, to below the setting where it had been cool, when going to bed, then woke in the middle of the night at what felt like 100 degrees, which gave me a severe headache. Had to turn on AC, which worked well.</td></tr>

They would not upgrade, even though I received 3 e-mails offering upgrade, ech of which I responded to but was uniformly turned down. Housekeeping staff knocked on my door and even called my room, 6 times in 2 days, twice while on conference calls with Do Not Disturb sign out.

Curtis in the bar area had the most vibrant personality and a very Can-do attitude. I couldn't have asked for a more attentive waiter. Jeff, the most helpful person I encountered during my stay. He helped me ship packages, a very amazing go to guy. Lane, loved his outgoing personality and the fact that he went above and beyond to find me a perfect restuarant for the evening. And Finally Maggie, who gave excellent recommendations for music and food in the area and even provided me with literature to learn more about the city. I couldn't possibly ask for a better staff, willing to drop what they are doing to help you. I love the personalities of each I encountered and their can-do spirit.

It could be a wonderful hotel with a fantastic staff in an outstanding location BUT my stay was absolutely tarnished by two employees in Guest Services. While travelling for a conference, I had only a few spare hours to spend at a nearby park. A fellow hotel guest/conference attendee and myself went to Guest Services to buy tickets. Not being from the area, we would hope they could cordially help us understand what our options were in terms of pricing and transportation. This seemed to be a major inconvenience for them as we received one-word answers to our questions, enormous attitude (I was told to "be quiet" at one point) and ultimately were disrespected as the two women, Ruth and Mabel, talked about us negatively as we were standing right in front of them. They told us they didn't believe us that we were hotel guest/conference attendees and assumed we were trying to scam discounted tickets. We then went to the Concierge and were helped by two of the hotels most welcoming and helpful employees, Amanda and Justin. They were also treated rudely by Ruth and Mabel themselves as they tried to assist us while buying tickets. Overall, I sadly cannot say I recommend this hotel as they employ these two deplorable women in guest services. I have not been treated with such disrespect in my entire life.</td></tr>

By the night of day four, the smell was so terrible that I had to place towels at the base of the bathroom door to mask the smell.

The only downside is the ageing of the rooms. The furniture was outdated, and the curtains were cut to allow room for an old-school air con vent which allowed a lot of light in from the minute the sun was up. Other than that, I was well looked after and the bar, restaurant, pool rival many places in Cali. Good for business and pleasure.</td></tr>

San Cristobal (the best of the five original forts in OSJ) is about 4 blocks behind the hotel, and you can also rent a variety of modern cars right on-site at Hertz. For "Americanized" coffee drinkers, you'll find a Starbucks on the way to San Cristobal, La Fortaleza Street (the OSJ shopping and dining district) is two blocks away, and you can't beat Caficultura (and, to a lesser extent, the famed La Bombonera) for breakfast just three blocks away (in different directions). You can pick up the OSJ Wall and accompanying Walkway steps from the hotel door, and we even walked across the bridge into Condado for a jaunt in the major Hotel District and the Condado beaches. Finally, the hotel has an on-site casino, which, though tiny, gives you what you need if you're a gambler and need your fix. It's also the ONLY casino in OSJ, but NOTE: ther are only about 300 slots and a handful of tables, and the slots simply DO NOT pay out, so go elsewhere for fun and a potential payday!</td></tr>

Their burgers used to be about $10.00, now they charge almost $20, definitively not work it!

The bar closed WAY too early by midnight. The hotel is stuck in the 1990s with NO WIFI connection in the hotel rooms. It was only offered in the lobby area so it could be falsely advertised. The nickle and dime atmosphere of greed was imposed upon us during our stay very often. One example is that Shortly after checkout while waiting in the lobby for departure we discovered the hotel immediately cut us off the WIFI lobby connection. We did not feel like guests but instead felt we were being drained of our wallets every second of our stay right down to departure. We were not left with a welcome feeling at all and therefore decided we would definitely NOT stay again at any Belvoir in the future. We get so much for for our money at other Hotel chains.</td></tr>

If you're traveling in warmer months though it looks like a fun setup. There's also a huge hot tub that's covered. The staff said it's never worked, which was strange. The front desk and the staff we spoke with were very helpful and friendly. Must have been a busy weekend because we couldn't get a room on club level and even though I called ahead and made a note on my online reservation that we wanted two queens and a fridge and microwave we only got the fridge after I noticed it wasn't in the room.

I own 2 separate properties with Grandbourne & pay huge money each month & huge yearly fees to be treated like this , does Gold status & a confirmation # mean nothing ?</td></tr>

Most lower-end hotels offer a refrigerator in hotel rooms. Other than that, I liked the hotel from the moment we stepped into the lobby. Our room was large with two large beds and night stands, a lounge chair with a foot rest, desk with FREE internet service, large picture window, dresser with a television, closet with a Terry Cloth Robe. The bathroom had all of the amenities that you would expect from Belvoir. We did not use much of the hotel because it was an overnight stay. I plan to visit again.</td></tr>

The food menu was poor and the quality of food that came was equally as poor - shame the price was premium.

I had to wait 4 hours for my room and all I received was a coffee voucher. I felt like because I was not a 35 yr old business man with a $15,000 limit on an American Express card, I was treated differently. After I finally got to my room, had a shower, and calmed down. I was able to talk to the manager and I was finally treated with some respect and dignity. Although, I could not get the room request I wanted I did get complimentary breakfast which did make up for part of my experience. I just did not expect to treated this way at an establishment of this caliber. After this I was treated better. The view and room was amazing and I will go back I just hope that I will get my requests and be treated the way I deserve to be treated in the future.</td></tr>

I called the hotel at least two weeks before our stay and asked the reservation desk if there was a special rate for our group and was told they did not show one at this time.I booked my room that night online through the Belvoir website. 24 hours later I received an email from our corporate office let us know that we need to call the catering manager (Angelina) to book at our special rate. So that next morning I called and explained that I had just booked 2 rooms and would like to get the special rate and was told this would be no problem. I thought this was all I needed to do. When we checked out I noticed we were paying the regular rate and inquired about it, they told me I need to talk to Angelina. I called and left her a voicemail on March 29th @ 6:15am and never got a response back. On April 5th @ 12:44pm I attempted to contact Angelina a second time about our rate being changed over and never received a call back. On April 11th @ 12.07pm I called for a third time and request a call back. Angelina called @ 1.28pm and said that I would not receive the rate that we were promised and that someone from our group should have communicated it to use. I find this completely unacceptable!!! I booked the room with Belvoir, I was told by a Belvoir employee I would receive our rate, and after the fact Belvoir did not honor its agreement. I am highly disappointed and will not be considering Belvoir in future.</td></tr>

Most @wood hotels pre check platinum guests. Not here. No recognition until I asked about the platinum amenities. Was told my room was almost ready. Almost meant 2.5 hours later and 1.5 hours after check in time. Front desk manager was ineffective. In the meantime, we went to the pool bar for a late lunch. Extremely overpriced. $8 for a $2 NYC pushcart hot dog which would have been much better. What's up with the pita chips? Fries cost too much? Come on. Oh, and don't ask for Dijon mustard or onions because either the server isn't allowed to get a side of onions and I was told that Dijon mustard doesn't go with anything on the menu. Hello? Ever heard of a hamburger? When asked to speak with a manager, both the onions and Dijon emerged.</td></tr>

But my experience this time was less than stellar. Apparently the hotel was dealing with an unruly set of guests this last Monday night/Tuesday am and the guests decided to respond by pulling the fire alarm at 3:30 am. That was not their fault of course, but they could have handled it better. All the guests went down to the lobby as instructed for about 30 minutes. No one from management talked to us in an organized fashion to let us know what was going on. We found out what happened through word of mouth. Then we were instructed to go upstairs with no apology and the alarm was still going so we had to try to go to sleep with the alarm still ringing for 15-20 minutes after we got back to our room. Really poor communication and execution of a plan to guests who were greatly inconvenienced by this incident (there were many families affected with small children for example). Again, the incident was not the hotel's fault, but a situation like this is when a hotel's staff has a chance to shine in how they handle it. There was no acknowledgement of our inconvenience and nothing was done to try to make up for it. I hope they learn from it and don't miss an opportunity like this next time. I really like this hotel in general.</td></tr>

My daughter's standard chicken tenders and fries were fine but both of the adult meals had to go back. My pasta was cold to the touch as were my wife's potatoes and her $30 steak was overcooked and tasteless. I will compliment the hostess because she was helping out the wait staff quite a bit and was very pleasant with us. Pool was supposed to close at 10 but when we got there at about 935 we were told by the lifeguard she was closing in 5 minutes because she had to take the towels down. We convinced her that we would be there until 10. The next morning I was promptly given a shuttle ride to my meeting place and my thanks to the staff for that. Breakfast was to be served until 11AM however when my wife took our daughter down at a little after 10 she was told that they were closing the restaurant early for an event and that she could possibly get something at the bar which was closed. She went to the front desk to ask where she could get something to feed our girl. Kudos to Regina, she promptly corrected the problem with the staff and the restaurant and took very good care of both my wife and daughter. I stay one to two nights a week at hotels and have to say that this was probably one of the least favorable ventures, ever.</td></tr>

I am an easy person to please and understand the ups and downs of a work day. My expectations are that when I come to hotel where I am a relative regular that I am at least somewhat recognized with "welcome back" and not treated as though this is the first time I have stayed at your place -it is cold and unfriendly. When I am here, I eat every night at your bar/restaurant and the service is marginal at best/I keep hoping it is going to get better! I may sit there while many waiters walk by and will not make eye contact. It only takes a little, "hello, I'll be with you in a minute" and then get back to me..to make me happy. I travel alone and a little "care" goes a long way with me. I think of your hotel as my home away from home and your staff as members of my away from home family - or at least friends or acquaintances. My point is that a very little - no big deal or really extra extra effort - goes a long way with me - and I expect I'm not the only traveler that feels that way. Thank you, Karen</td></tr>

This stay was sub par across the board.</td><td>4</td><td>The worst customer service received at a Belvoir to date.</td><td>First of all, I have stayed here before, I have given this hotel a good review in the past, and obviously every stay can be different. Unfortunately this stay was, and currently is not up to par. The whole reason for this negative review is customer service. My wife checked us into the hotel as I had to stay late at our office. I will say its my fault I did not put her on the reservation so she had a hard time checking in. Once checked in she was "upgraded" to a room that did not appear to have been cleaned. At this point she did not want to deal with the hotel because of her ordeal checking in so I called in from the office. The person on the phone was quite rude to me and in a very glib tone tells me "well sir, she is more than welcome to go down to the front desk at any time to change rooms" Okay, I say well can you move her to a club floor lounge as we are platinum members. He says there is room, so my wife goes downstairs and she is moved not to the club floor but to another lower level room in the other towers, she is not excited but at least it is clean. I called in to speak with the manager about all this and am told she is busy, Okay so I leave a message. I am not even given the courtesy of a return call to my message. Frankly I am floored. My wife likened it to feeling like she "booked on priceline" and was given the second class citizen treatment. There are several 4 star hotels in downtown Seattle that are cheaper; we book at BPG properties for our platinum status, and the service that comes along with an BPG property. The ball was dropped, and dropped miserably on this stay. Again, this is not a comment on the hotel as a whole, its a comment on how we were treated this stay. Maybe it didnt help that we stayed at a St. Regis the night before, but should not all BPG properties aspire to have that level of customer service?</td></tr>

Was ready to call front desk to tell them iron didn't work but we decided that the outlet didn't work after we crawled on the floor and under a table to another outlet. There was no room to set up ironing board at 2nd outlet, so hunted for 3rd outlet, which was behind the headboard and awkward to get to. This is when we found out why the clock was blinking when we entered the room, housekeeping couldn't use the accesible outlet so they unplugged the clock.</td></tr>

It offers a fantastic location and FREE parking! They also have a free shuttle which operates every hour to the Secaucus Train Station. Just be careful on the return as the shuttle picks up at the station at 4:15 and not again until 6:45. We didn't pay attention to the schedule and ended up having to take a taxi back to the hotel. We stayed on the club floor and highly recommend it! Evening snacks (quesadillas, cheeses, crackers, fruit, cookies, soda, water, coffee, tea) were provided and were delicious and plentiful. The next morning we enjoyed the breakfast (eggs, pancakes, muffins, bagels, fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee, tea). This is a real saver as there really is no restaurants near the hotel. We also enjoyed the pool area and fitness center. The pool was very warm (really too warm) and the hot tub was relaxing. The only recommendation I have is to put rubber mats by the pool as we saw a man fall and then later my daughter fell. The tile is very slippery when wet. Overall, it is a fantastic hotel with a super location whether you are visiting NYC or the Meadowlands. We look forward to staying here in the future.</td></tr>

I can't say enough about this hotel! It's location is perfect, right in the heart of Manhattan. There is a subway entrance right outside and the location made it convenient to stop by the hotel for a rest, drink, etc. We stayed on the club floor which was fabulous! The club lounge was incredible and the best we have enjoyed of any Belvoir. In the evening, there were scrumptious hors d'oeuvres (hot munchies, veggies, dip, cheese, crackers, delicious kettle chips, cookies & non-alcoholic drinks). The breakfast was incredible with assorted hot & cold cereals, a delicious variety of fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, coffee, tea). The breakfast was available until 11 which was very convenient. And the club lounge is open 24 hours a day so you can go and grab a soda, water, tea or coffee. The coffee machine offered lattes, cappuccinos, cocoa, etc. After a long day, grab some pastries at Fluffy's one block over from the Belvoir (excellent and reasonably priced) and take them back to the lounge to enjoy with a drink. The room was remodeled and clean. The room & bathroom are small but that is standard in NYC. The beds are very comfy. We are gold members and were able to check out of our room at 4 which was very helpful. The only (almost) negative was they seem to charge to hold your luggage ($3.25 per bag). We got to the hotel in the AM and the room wasn't ready since check in is at 3, so we checked our bags but when we came to get our luggage, they didn't charge us. Overall, this is a fantastic Belvoir! We can't wait to visit again!!</td></tr>

The kids were playing soccer in the halls and pushing in front of you on the elevator. The staff said there was not much they could do. Also the door knob in our bathroom was broken and we asked that it would be fixed and never was. The weekend maids would not clean the room very good either. After two nights of this I would never recommend this hotel or ever stay at a Belvoir again since this must be their training.</td></tr>

They try to keep the dogs contained to a couple floors, as to not disturb other guests but still make us all feel welcome. And, while we are usually forced to sacrifice something to bring the dog, this place is clean, well-maintained and offers everything we could want for a family vacation. I'm looking forward to seeing what the renovations bring - the kids loved the old zero-entry outdoor pool and the indoor pool was great for cool or rainy days. The staff is usually responsive but not necessarily proactive (they are skimpy with room towels but will bring more if you ask and don't offer BPG extras/upgrades, etc.). If you have a dog, it can be challenging to arrange for maid service - it would be great if they offered to set an appointment time for cleaning pet rooms. And, it would be nice if they honored some of the other Grandbourne rate specials, especially for extended stays. Everything considered, for the price, location and amenities, we haven't found a better hotel in Virginia, Maryland or Delaware that better meets our family's needs for a great beach vacation. We are looking forward to our next visit.</td></tr>

My stay lasted 4 nights. I called the hotel from the airport to ask about a shuttle. The person seemed quite busy and abrupt with me. There was no hotel shuttle to/from the airport, but a pay shuttle service was available ($10 per person). Check-in went smoothly. The room was nice, and I felt very comfortable. One of the curtains was broken. Internet access could be paid for by the hour or the day; however, the hourly service wasnt working. In calling the front desk, I was told it hadnt been working for some time. I spoke with the staff 5 additional times during my stay. First, to ask about a shuttle or directions to the convention center. There was no shuttle, but the person gave me walking directions. She was polite. Second, to ask about how late the shuttle ran to/from the airport. The person at the desk was unsure, and had trouble flagging down another person who knew. This other person (a head bellhop? he seemed to be someone directing other employees) seemed very rushed and didnt seem to want to be bothered. His answer was quick and abrupt almost as if annoyed. Third, to ask about local coffee shops and restaurants. It took a while to get help because employees were joking around and talking with each other one of whom was the same gentleman who seemed annoyed at my shuttle schedule question. He walked away without a word and let someone else help me. The other two times were with maids. Both of them seemed very concerned with my overall comfort they were quite pleasant to talk to. I ate at the hotel restaurant my last night. Dinner and service were great!</td></tr>

Free internet in lobby was great, as was the restaurant's daily breakfast - especially the omelettes. My only complaint is a common one - the cost for parking. All in all though, I'm somewhat surprised this is only a category 3 hotel.</td></tr>

We checked in we were given a room on the way up to the room I noticed the temp was rather hot when we arrived in the room it was miserable so we turned AC on high and went to dinner. We got to ride in a limo supplied by the hotel made us feel special. We was gone 3 1/2 hours when we returned to the room it was still on the warm side so I turned the AC on higher. Got ready for bed and thought I would watch some TV; however the remote would not work. Awoke at 4am in a sweat decided I couldn't take anymore so spoke with the gentleman at the front desk he told me to talk with management to see if they could make it right I called and asked to speak with the Manager I was given to a man that said his name was Corey no last name and I told him my story he said he would put a work order in to see if it needed repair. I would not recommend this specific hotel from my experience.</td></tr>

The renovation shows. The lobby is sleek and modern, and though I was never in the hotel to enjoy it the main floor bar area was always a happening place. The rooms were noticeably renovated and comfortable. The staff was awesome. For the first few nights my Green Choice doorknocker (turning away maid service) was ignored, but each time I brought it up, the staff immediately added the bonus points to my BPG account. They brought up a fridge the moment one became available, and they let us use one of their landline phones to book several attractions in the area, rather than forcing us to go back to our room and pay $2 per local call to do it that way. And always with a friendly smile and a great attitude. The location of the hotel was great for us - close to Universal with a free shuttle, and close to a Metro station which provided easy access to Hollywood and also to downtown LA. I was very pleased with my stay.</td></tr>

They all go above and beyond to please the guests. The pool area is great for both kids and adults, and is so large that you never feel crowded. The 2 golf courses on site at Whirlwind Golf Club are outstanding and run by Troon Golf. The resort is a bit out of the way, south of Phoenix on the outskirts of Chandler, but it works for me.

The hotel has a nice pool right off the bar. It's a bit small with no bathrooms/changing rooms nearby (you need to walk through the bar to get there) but it's quite nice. While the hotel was lovely, service still needs work. The staff when we checked in was quite nice. Our room was upgraded but we were asked to wait until 5:30 for our room to be ready because the pipes in the original room we were slated for weren't working due to construction.

We turned on the air unit only to have it blowing hot air although we had adjusted the temperature to 68 degrees. After about 30 minutes in the room only warm air was blowing, we called the front desk and advised them of our problem and they stated that it would be taken care of prior to our return that evening. My wife and I arrived around 3am that morning only to find the room at around 90 degrees plus. We contacted the front desk once again to voice our concerns and we were placed in another room. We adjusted the temperature in this room to 70 degrees only to find out that the hotel had control over the AC units independently and warm air was still blowing. We woke up about 10am that morning and my wife was showering, she rotated the water temperature handle only to have it get stuck on her in the hot mode and she quickly wrapped the shower curtain around her to avoid scorching. I immediately went to the front desk and asked for the manager as this was getting frustrating having issues with each room we were placed into. The manager sadly to say did not show any remorse to what was happening to us only that she would send someone to take care of it. The manager was a tad bit prudent so I contacted BPG customer service who managed to take care of the situation for us. We were provided with some hotel comps and a 7th floor room. I recommend this hotel seek better ways to improve its management staff as this was a true let down of the Belvoir Hotel name. I would not venture to come back to this hotel. By the way we moved 3 times in this hotel, my arms were getting rubbery from all the packing and unpacking.</td></tr>

Not sure what happened but the room was nice only issue was not getting my bottled water everyday, but with club access it wasn't that big of a deal. The staff here do a great job for the most part.

We needed one night to stay over before checking into our resort. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were top notch. The fitness center was very clean and the equipment was in very good condition. The cleaning staff does a great job at this location. The staff in the lobby were not what I would expect from Belvoir. We were charged $20.00 to park our 2 vehicles after we already paid $20.00 for a "resort useage fee" as an BPG member. I asked why I was being charged $20 for parking after I already paid $20 for "resort useage fees", and they said, "That $20 gets you internet, a bottle of water and getting to use the fitness center." I then asked for a late checkout as an BPG member since we could not check into the resort until late afternoon. The lady at the counter told us she would allow us to stay until 2pm instead of the 3pm that I requested and said, "I am sure they will have a room available for you by then." I explained to her that the resort check-in was not until 4pm, and she said that 2pm was all she would do. They then de-activated our room keys at 12:00 noon. The hotel staff here seems to not want any business from BPG members the way we were treated. The hotel as a whole is very nice and a wonderful location, but if you are an BPG member, do not expect to receive a very warm welcome or any accomidation from this hotel. I was very disappointed and do not plan to return to this hotel because of it. This is the first Belvoir hotel that I have stayed at in 10 years that I was treated so unwelcomed by the staff and therefore by the company. I truely hope that this is not the "new" Belvoir experience since this hotel has just been upgraded and remodeled. I hope it is an exception to the norm in the future because we love Belvoir and use it often. If you are looking for a nice hotel and want to spend money on resort fees, parking, and renting pool chairs, this is the place to go. If you are looking for a hotel and trying to use BPG benefits, it is the wrong place to go. I really hope this hotel becomes more BPG friendly because based on our stay this week, it is not.</td></tr>

The driver arrived early, but told me that someone had scheduled pick up at 9:00 or he wouldn't be there at all, and we had to wait until 9:00 before he would drive me to the hotel. It took one hour to get from the metro stop to the hotel. Upon arrival, I asked about the shuttle in the morning and found out it was already booked and the earliest I could get a ride to the metro was 9:00. The manager promised that she would be there in the morning and would find a way to get me to the metro at 7:00. When I went down early (after checking out the club lounge with the worst breakfast options ever, and it didn't open until 6:30) the manager was not on premises and I ended up sharing a taxi with another stranded working guest and our own additional expense.

The staff was very nice except for one young lady at the front desk who lectured me on self-parking. Service was good at the bar the first night, but the second night when it was crowded, we left after 20 minutes at a table when the waitress just walked by ignoring us. Bell service and the parking team were great, and through no fault of theirs, self-parking was not available either Saturday as there was an event each week.

You know a hotel must be good when they are booked out on certain dates you want to stay there. Our family of 4 wanted to stay 12 nights but it was Easter so probably a busier time. At first there was a period of 3 nights we would have to go and stay elsewhere because they were fully booked but I checked a couple of times and in the end I was able to get the whole 12 nights here and I am so glad. We had 2 ocean front rooms booked so the teenagers could have thier own room and we all had a little more space from each other. We had an interconnecting door which was great because we only closed it at bedtime and every other time we were in the rooms it was like we were all together anyway. We honestly could not complain about anything during our stay. We were happy with the rooms on the 19th floor overlooking the infinity pool which was great. The ocean looks so blue and amazing when you look out. At night you can kick back on the balcony and listen to the music below or watch the firedancer show. Beds are so comfy and the hotel staff are so friendly always saying aloha as you pass them in the hallway. The staff at the travel desk are so helpful in booking or reconfirming any day tours. We loved the fact that the hotel was right on the beach and also so close to walk to the shops. This was our first overseas holiday and I am so glad we chose to spend all our nights at the Belvoir Waikiki. Make sure you try the freshly baked cookies from the cookie shop. We were there nearly everyday as we fell in love with the choc chip cookies. After seeing where some hotels are located in proximity to the beach and shops I know that I booked the best place to stay. We really could not fault our stay in any way and we know we will return for another relaxing break in the near future.</td></tr>

The front desk could not change a $20 bill, there wasn't any place in the hotel to get or buy a bottle of water, when I went downstairs to eat dinner, the restaurant was closed except for 5 little tables in the bar, which was dark, noisy and depressing, so I could not eat dinner. I left a note on the bed asking the maids to change my linens, but they didn't do it, they just made up the bed with the same sheets. I asked for a shower cap, but they didn't have any. I felt like I was staying at a cheap freeway motel that didn't have any amenities. The room key was suppose to let me in and out of the parking lot but every time except one, it didn't work and I had to call the valet to have him open the gate. I paid a lot per night and I feel very ripped off. As a premiere Grandbourne member, who travels a great deal, I expected much more from this hotel. I sent two emails to the manager but kept getting form letters back, and I have not been contacted with my concerns. One positive note, the staff were all very nice.</td></tr>

Although I very much appreciated the free wifi, I was quite disappointed in the facilities. First, the area around the hotel is under massive construction, making access to te hotel from the highway darn near impossible. My cab driver spent so much time driving around looking for some secret back entrance that my cab bill from the airport was almost as much as my nightly rate. I expressed my frustration to the desk clerk, and she conveyed a sense that she could not have cared less. When I got to my room, the sink was completely cracked. It was as if someone had smashed it with a heavy object. I could see this at a bargain basement brand hotel, but not at a Grandbourne property. I expect better.</td></tr>

We enjoyed it very much.</td></tr>

In the morning, I was locked out of my room after going to the gym, and complaining about my bill. Very frustrating.</td></tr>

The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, etc.... I was woken up throughout the night and extremely early every morning to a sound comparable to a jet engine. Every time the person next to us (maybe above us) used the water, it sounded like we were ready to take off on an airplane. Please check into this, as we love the Belvoir! We stayed in room #2417. Also, I feel as though $5.32 is outrageous for a 12 oz. can of coke. You should have a mini fridge in each room to give your guests the choice of purchasing your overpriced items or bringing their own. I also think that $14 for a glass of white wine is ludicrous (at the downstairs bar). These prices only make staying at a hoetel unattainable to some. It's no wonder I only can afford to do it through the company I work for. My husband and I would never be able to afford it otherwise, and we're a middle class working couple who need to get away sometimes! I'm sorry to say all of this, but I'm hoping it will help you make some positive changes for the future.</td></tr>

Recommend making this a "King" room. The sound from the adjacent guest room was clearly (and annoyingly) loud--even though they didn't seem to be unusually loud themselves--just the room wasn't insulated very well. The club room was the least maintained of any I've experienced in a while--that may be due to some guest families spending a great deal of time there. I stayed there on "points" but in general I wouldn't recommend the experience to anyone else--especially for business trips.</td></tr>

However, the staff moved me to another room with minimal fuss.</td><td>3</td><td>True San Antonio Experience</td><td>When you travel for work and stay at chains you sometimes wake up and forget what city you are in. Not so with the Gunter. This is a great historic hotel with uniquely decorated rooms. The staff is consistently friendly, efficient and ready to assist with whatever you may need. Because of this I frequently stay at the Gunter when in town for business, Fiesta events, or concerts at the Majestic and Empire theaters. All are within walking distance and you avoid the hassle of post event traffic. Plus you can grab a quick nightcap at Barrons which has a beautiful antique bar.</td></tr>
