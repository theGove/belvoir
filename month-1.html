Walls were severely scratched and the wall paper was peeling in places. Lighting fixtures were loose. Again, nothing can be perfect but the staff still was friendly.</td></tr>

We checked out 1 day early because of the heat. When we pulled out of the garage, we heard through the walkie talkie to get us out asap because we were complainers. The comment was made to us during our stay that others complained about the heat as well. This is not what I expect from Belvoir.</td></tr>

I was told I couldn't have the Disneyland tickets until the 2nd room was ready. I complained and was finally given the tickets. When we returned, we got the 2nd room. My daughter was going to take a shower and let us know the bathroom had no towels. It took about 15 minutes to get towels to our room. The shuttle to Disneyland is overcrowded and you are likely to have to wait to get back to the hotel. On one trip in to Disneyland the shuttle driver informed us he as not going back to Disneyland and we had to wait another 1/2 hour past the scheduled time. The rooms were fine, but the service and organization were not. It was like the hotel had just opened that day and they were working out the bugs. Problem is, it wasn't the first day.</td></tr>

My BPG status was acknowledged and I received a room upgrade at check-in. Things I observed: 1. there was no hotel key card required to enter through the rear hotel entrance; 2. one of the washcloths in our bathroom had some old stain that didn't bleach out; 3. children under 16 are not allowed into the BPG club room, which is annoying for those members traveling with families; to be fair, they did offer a voucher for breakfast at the restaurant, but still odd as no other hotel has refused entry to the club room for children. Perhaps most concerning, though, was the knock on the door in the morning from some middle-aged women claiming to be housekeeping and holding what looked like a key card (a master perhaps) while still wearing a coat and carrying a handbag. I can't say that made me feel all that safe, and though I reported it to the front desk, they never called back to report on what they found.</td></tr>

To begin they did not give us a suite upgrade which is required at all Belvoir hotels because I am a platinum member. They said we could still use the Club suite so I thought ok I will deal with it. From the time we got off of the elevator we smelled a horrible musk smell and the hallway looked more like a motel than a nice hotel. The top problem was that we were obviously on a floor with all dogs. For starters I did not know dogs were even allowed in the hotel! We had constant barking all night long and morning! So much for my romantic getaway... The bathroom needed to be remolded terribly bad and the most disgusting part of the room was the nasty floor. The carpet was soiled, stained and spotted so bad that I did not dare take off my shoes while walking around. I wanted to cry! I will never stay at this hotel again it was the worst New Year's Eve ever!</td></tr>

My major concern is with the shuttles and transportations they offered on the resort. They have a boat that takes you to the Rawhide location, however it is controlled by an independent party. The staff failed to tell me how unreliable the boat was and I unfortunately had to wait over an hour for a boat that never appeared at their resort. None of the front desk seemed to really care about my misfortune. Luckily, a manager there was very concerned and offered a listening ear. The restaurants were great and the facility offers a peaceful vibe. The pools were nice to have even though the jacuzzi could have been warmer in temperature. The business center had plenty of workstations to use from. My only other minor concerns are the location of the fitness center (it appeared there's a charge to use it???) and no vending machines for a late night soda.

And although the hotel staff is wonderful, there were some shortcomings that could have been prevented. (1) I stayed in a suite, which I would never do again. Why? Because all the suites, I was told, are next to the elevator. And to make things worse, the bedroom is located adjacent to the elevator shaft. And worse yet, the bed's headboard abuts the elevator shaft wall so all you hear is the elevator going up and down until the wee hours of the morning. So if you are a light sleeper, you can forget about getting a good night's sleep. (2) The sofa in the suite is worn out, it's too deep and there are no pillows to rest against, making the sofa virtually impossible to really use comfortably. (3) the remote for the TV in the living room wouldn't work; had to request a new one and it took several attempts for housekeeping to bring one that would work. (4) I was given access to the lounge on the 16th floor, I assume because of my Gold Preferred Status. And on a few visits, the food wasn't being replenished and it required me having to call the front desk and being told to go to the restaurant for breakfast, albeit complimentary. (5) New Year's Eve was a debacle in the making. It was like a university's dormitory with all the noise that lasted until about 3am with kids being allowed to run up and down the hallways yelling at each other, doors repeatedly being slammed, etc. I called the front desk about it, they were sympathetic but obviously didn't have the ability to stop it. (6) then there was the couple in the adjacent room (locked door connecting our two rooms) who decided that everyone needed to hear them having relations at 2am with the woman reciting lines from a cheap adult movie for about 30 minutes. I'm only grateful that my 14 year old daughter wasn't staying with me at the time.</td></tr>

I immediately was concerned as I checked in and had a very rude valet person. Whatever...it's new years eve and I am sure this young person does not want to be working, the staff that checked me in was very nice and even mentioned they upgraded me. When I arrived at my room there were two men that appeared to be replacing a television that was missing from the wall. I was just dropping off my bags and they assured me that they needed to get some brackets and would get a tv to hook up. We returned to the hotel late that night and I noticed a few things...one NO TV..two a mess around where there should be a tv.....and three NO note explaining why there is no tv. I called the front desk and got answer after many rings. What kind of upgrade is this? Wife and I were looking very forward to a little room service in the morning and a little TV....not something you ever get with little ones at home. I know this i seems small, the room was relatively clean outside of the mess from the people that were supposed to put the tv, the bed was not the sweet sleeper that they mentioned on the website when i signed up(another disappointment and misleading advertisement). We stayed here to expect Grandbourne quality (I have stayed in over 100 Grandbournes around the world) and this is not what was delivered. I am actually very disappointed I was charged for not getting what I signed up for. There are many great hotels in downtown fort worth and at least in this experience this did not live up to one of them.</td></tr>

The best feature for us is the proximity of the hotel to Universal studio. Also adding a ref to the room would definitely help since these stuff are standard anyways in any hotel.</td></tr>

The front desk calls room service to inquire and the person on the phone HANGS UP on the front desk clerk. She is embarassed and I ask her if she just got hung up on by another employee and she embarassingly agrees. She apologizes profusely for the room service clerks terrible behavior, but it's too late at this point. If they treat their coworkers like this don't expect you to get anything better. Needless to say the room service was cancelled. The room itself was sub par. The end table was broken on one corner. The bathroom had visible stains in the tub.</td></tr>

Furthermore, I was not expecting to find this treatment among the hustle of Center City-Philadelphia. Quite the contrary, the Belvoir management and staff made the difference in my hotel choice all year. From weekly greetings by Patrick to helped with my luggage, to checking-in with Candace and Andrew at the front desk, I was made to feel welcome. Top it off with exceptional service in the lobby bar & restaurant all year by Nicole, Peter, Greg, Daniele, and Amanda. Breakfast with Nick or a coffee and danish with Marilyn, they each made me feel at home while away from home from the start. Thanks for taking such good care of me!

I got the expected apologies, but nobody seemed to put two and two together that my room keys would no longer work. It occurred to me that might be the case, so I checked myself a little while later and sure enough they were inactive. I went down to the lobby to handle that problem, and the gentleman who checked me in was a bit short with me but still apologetic. I got some story about the system crashing, but he then proceeded to quickly reactivate my keys so who knows if that was true or not.</td></tr>

The staff is attentive to needs; whether personal or group related and the food is excellent! The location is great as it is just off of I-95 with ample parking, but not in the middle of downtown so there is a quietness when in the hotel. The sales and catering groups make business events easy and the rooms and setups can fit any need. Working with the sales manager to plan and hold events has been a pleasure and he makes sure nothing has been forgotten. During my last visit in December I encountered two individuals that are prime examples of the high level of service this hotel provides. The woman attending to guests needs on the Club Level greets everyone with a smile. I had questions about Portsmouth and she was more than willing to take some time to discuss the local area. The other employee was assigned to our group (27 people) for a formal luncheon. she asked questions before the attendees arrived about timing of the luncheon (presentations, speeches, awards ceremony, etc) to time her movements in the room so not to be a distraction. She was attentive to the needs of the group and made sure the presentation of dinner and dessert tables was perfect and maintained throughout the event. These were just two examples of a great customer service that stuck out amongst others at the desk, sales and restaurant that make visiting the Portsmouth Harborside a pleasant experience!</td></tr>

It is close to the airport and a short drive to downtown. The rooms are nice, clean, and comfortable. The food from the restaurant was great. The workout room is acceptable. Our service was very poor in comparison to other Belvoirs that I have visited. There were no bellmen availible to help us with our luggage. I ordered roomservice for breakfast. I called back after the order was delivered to ask for a spoon and was told, "We do not have time to bring you just a spoon. We will bring it when we can." The next morning I ordered a bagel and the woman taking the order asked me to come pick it up at the restaurant instead of delivering it to my room. In my opnion, a hotel with the reputation and comitment to quality like Belvoir should have known that they would be at full capacity and made better preperations for the weekend.</td></tr>

During my last stay, I noticed the bed skirt was stained all along one side and what looked like a bag of mini pretzels that had been dumped (by a previous guest) in the corner of the room. Now I understand that "things happed", but what really annoyed me was the way the Housekeeping Manager addressed the problem. After changing the bed linens and re-vacuuming the room, no one said "I'm Sorry". In fact, I felt like they were annoyed to have to re-clean the room. Their attitude really turned me off. If there was another Grandbourne property anywhere else I would not stay at this hotel again. Alas there is not so I'm stuck with these people when visiting Harrisbug</td></tr>

After a few moments, one agent, Nathalie, finally looked up to check me in. I had booked a club-level room. When Nathalie checked me in, she told me that I had been "upgraded" to a deluxe room. I asked her whether this was a room on the club level, since of course a deluxe room not on the club would be a downgrade rather than an upgrade to my reservation. She explained that they were "enhancing" the club level and were not assigning any guests to that floor, even though the reservation system of course was selling rooms as "club level". I told her that I would not pay the club level rate to stay in a non-club room (even if they would provide access to the lounge), so she called another agent over. The other agent quickly informed her that she was wrong and went ahead and assigned me to the club level room, since the "enhancements" had been completed several days before. So, in other words, Nathalie caused this whole issue for no reason by being ill-informed about the status of the enhancements to the hotel. What I resented the most, however, is that she tried to dupe me into thinking that I had received an "upgrade" when in fact I had been downgraded. She also tried to tell me that the non-club room to which she was assigning me would have the same amenities as a club room (like the bathrobe, slippers, bottled water, etc), which of course is not true--the website specifically lists these as club level room- only benefits. I found it very insulting that she would treat a customer this way when it was she who was ill-informed about basically every question I asked her.</td></tr>

There are better places to stay nearby</td><td>4</td><td>Lots of stays here but never again</td><td>The utter lack of recognition for a Platinum member is amazing! Here's how to kill your hotel with Platinum guests - start with sending a message suggesting we spend 30% more for a "club level" room. If it's available Platinum is supposed to get upgraded. At check-in be told you've been upgraded (but not to the best available) because access to your floor is restricted. Of course the room is the same size, amenities are the same, and it is exactly the same as non-"restricted" floors, but HEY! it's an upgrade! By the way, that "welcoming gift"? You better want points because the front desk staff is going to give you an alternative by asking. Go to your room and find they've ignored your requests for extra towels and pillows. (This is guaranteed or compensated in other plans folks!) Now ask for those additional items and have the person delivering only the towels drop them off and just leave without a word. What a stupid guest, you should have KNOWN those extra pillows were in a bag in the closet (where they may have been for the last 6 months for all you know.) Check the next day, and find out there's an entire floor of much larger, nicer rooms on the executive level. And guess what? They are available for your entire stay. Now be told you can reserve that level next time (at additional cost of course.) So much for the upgrade, but we're not done. Now if you really want to put a dagger in the hotel's Platinum heart, have one of your keys not work. Then send your spouse down with your Platinum key-jacket to get one that does. Can you see this coming? The staff person keeps the non-working key and says you need your ID (that's back up in the room) because they want to be security conscious. The Platinum jacket isn't enough because you might have found or stolen it. It doesn't matter that they talked to you less than 24 hours ago and heard your complaints then. Please, Platinum member, we must abuse you just a bit more. Stayed here more than 10 years and probably close to 50 times but I'm done. I recommend you stay away from here if you are an elite member who knows how a property is SUPPOSED to treat you. They didn't even send a manager to talk to me.</td></tr>

Waitstaff had little knowledge of the specials or how food was to be prepared, even after I asked them to check. Water goblet was filled for the first time half way through the meal.

Entire lobby and atrium is blocked off by black plastic as it is gutted to concrete slab. I believe some of the rooms have been renovated. But most have not and they are about 8 years past due. Many people who were staying more than one night were checking out to go somewhere else. Staff seemed very disenterested and extremely slow. As a part of the renovation they have set up some type of ventialation system which involved most ot the out side windows on one floor being open with plastic tubes hanging out making a constant and very loud flapping sound. Honestly should have just shut down this property while they renovate. Very bad brand experience.</td></tr>

The convention brought over 200 people to this hotel and service was not good at all. Some staff were rude and not helpful when I called down to the front desk. Drinks were BEYOND EXPENSIVE.... We had an Awards Dinner 1 of the nights and had to purchase our drinks. A very small watered-down mixed drink was $11 and a can of coke was $6. I don't mind paying for service if it is GOOD Service. I was not pleased with the service at all. The restaurant inside the hotel was closed one of the days at lunch time, and another day had a very long wait time because they had 1 server to help everyone. I would think if you have a convention scheduled and this many people reserved to come to a convention in a room directly across from this restaurant in the hotel, you would schedule enough people to accommodate at least a portion of the people there. One of the mornings for breakfast, we went to the same restaurant and ordered 2 omelets for $50. Very very over-priced..... It was a very nice hotel, but sadly I would not recommend this place to anyone.</td></tr>

After waiting 10 minutes, we mentioned at the front desk that we weren't able to get a drink. The response was "Oh, they are closed." No, empathy what so ever. My first room didn't have a working internet connection and all rooms are wired connections not wireless. Finally, the Bay Tower is dated. Rooms are a good size, but it all feels old. Overall, it was an unimpressive stay made worse by a staff who seemed as if they couldn't care less.</td></tr>
