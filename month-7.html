We had some housekeeping issues we discovered upon check in. We asked to have them fixed and were disappointed to find they were not taken care of.Not what I am use to in a Belvoir propery. After speaking to another manager, things were taken care of. I'd say the cleanliness overall was a bit of a let down (dusty corners, dirty glasses, toenail on the floor) . But after they fixed the issues, our stay was great. The staff is friendly and polite. The hotel is perfectly situated in the downtown core so you can reach everything. Overall it ended up being a wonderful stay and we'd definitely stay here again.</td></tr>

Lovely beds, view, bathroom and color scheme, however the walls are thin and both our neighbours had children. The lobby was a screaming mess of young teenagers on a NY trip, I counted to at least three different groups and needless to say the few computers in the lobby were always busy. I met a man who had been put on a floor with one such group and he described his floor as "a carneval" and had been granted a switch of floors. The staff in general don't know how to smile and with the exception of the staff at the tickets & tours counter all other treat you as a trial put on them. Since this was our first trip to NY and the choices outside were overwhelming we tried to get tips on good eating places and other things. After a few attempts we realized why there never was a line-up. Also, this is the ONLY hotel ever that has charged me for storing my bags for a few hours between check-out and leaving for the airport. However, the location was great and the room lovely and I would probably stay here again since I like Belvoir.</td></tr>

No info was given until the alarm stopped ringing. The kids were scared, it ruined our final nights stay and were all very tired and weary the next and final day in Philly.

I only know this because he hand wrote a nice welcome note after my first night there. He replaced what needed to be replaced and left what I wanted them to leave. I have never understood why some hotels change your sheets every night even though I didn't put the card out. It was beastly hot in NY when I was there and the AC worked great in spite of my window facing into the sun. By NY standards, both the sleeping area and the bathroom were spacious. There is not a lot of closet/dresser space for two. I was fine alone. It was very clean with no bed bugs.</td></tr>

Walking distance to everything you need like Fisherman's Wharf for restaurants and shopping and all transportation needs. The hotel is probably a bit older from what I could tell. The rooms are nothing special. The bathrooms are very small, but who really needs a grand bathroom. It was a place to sleep. It wasn't all that quiet though was probably my biggest "complaint". There are only 4 floors so you can't get away from the street noise and I guess the windows are so old that they are not that sound proof. I have stayed in many big cities like New York and Chicago in other Grandbourne properties and never had noise like this. But, the location outweighs any gripes I had.</td></tr>

The ambience and facilities exceed that of most Belvoir properties. The staff is also exceptional. Front desk, valet, and wait staff are all friendly and professional. We have enjoyed this property many, many times and continue to choose it when visiting Kansas City. However, we will look elsewhere for our next visit. We arrived to a completely full hotel (based on adjoining convention center event - so call ahead and check). This meant that a very simple request, adjoining rooms, was not met. As a platinum member, I expect a reservation request made months in advance to be met. When traveling with our children, we want adjoining rooms. An upgrade is always nice, but adjoining rooms are essential. When we asked for a rollaway bed, we were told they were all taken, but we could have an air mattress. The air mattress was deflated by the morning. We were told we could move to adjoining rooms the next day. That was reasonable and we thought one night with full occupancy meant we could overlook the negatives of the first night. The next day, we were told by several staff members that the hotel was going to be so empty, that they were only using a few floors. What that meant was that we did indeed get adjoining rooms, but we were next to a barking dog and surrounded by slamming doors, and directly across from an ice machine that was used throughout the night. It also meant that the restaurant, which we really enjoy was closed for dinner one night. It also meant that there was construction noise in many areas. Apparently, when hotels are low occupancy, many projects are completed. The bottom line is that this is a great hotel. It is well kept. It is also staffed with friendly and professional people. However, call in advance and find out about occupancy! Too full and customer service and guest loyalty are not met. Too empty...you might regret the choice. I've had several great stays here, this one was well below my expectations.</td></tr>

Also on check out day, we had arranged for a late check out and so we went out for breakfast. Upon returning to our rooms, the keys would't work.

We did notice people drive pretty slowly around here. The stay here was so good that the distance did not bother us. Seldom was there traffic and the hotel is right off of Route 4, the main vein to all the parks. Very convenient! BTW - as BPG member, we used the Club Member Lounge. Again, food is great here!

From the moment we stepped into the hotel as guests, I noticed the lack of staff and respect from all employees. This hotel was severely understaffed for having not only a convention with over 800 people involved, but also several other large groups. I spoke with three gentlemen and a woman while checking in and out. The two that I spoke with checking in were very nice, but completely overwhelmed. The woman was completely rude. The gentleman I spoke to while checking out and he was very rude to me and other guests in line. And he was supposed to be the front desk supervisor. The housekeeping was slow and understaffed. Nor did they speak any English so when I asked if she could come back in 15 minutes when I was leaving, she had no idea what I was saying, so I had to vacate my room that I paid a lot of money for. Our biggest complaint was that they were not prepared for a group of our capacity. We had booked the rooms far enough in advance that there should not have been the wait we had. We had booked 2 rooms, neither were ready when we were there to check in at 3pm and one wasn't ready until 6:30 - our meetings started at 5:30. There were women in our group who didn't have rooms until after dinner had started at 8:00pm. Completely unacceptable.</td></tr>

I was in a suite on the 26th floor and had to go down twice, once because they deactivated my room key and the second time because there was a cockroach in my room! and I could not get through to anyone in Guest Services.

This meant that none of my relatives who booked rooms were given the "complimentary breakfast, afternoon hors doeuvres and a variety of beverage options". I was horribly embarrassed that my wedding invitations mentioned features that were only given to guests if they paid for suites. It wasn't clear enough on the website or in my communications with the hotel rep. When I spoke with the hotel staff about it the night of my arrival, they wouldnt offer anything other than that guests could pay the additional cost for the club level, meaning they would have to pay $30 more per room, would still have their regular rooms but could then have access to the 5th floor for the complimentary items. I also thought a "block of rooms" meant everyone would be on the same floor and had planned on everyone joining me while my hair and makeup was done in my suite on the wedding morning, however, I was on the 5th floor and everyone else was on the 3rd or 4th and the elevators didn't allow guests to go further than the floor that their room was on. Those without a room key couldn't use the elevator at all so when my stylist arrived and then later the photographer, I had to go down and get them (even though I was busy with other things). Then I had to have someone go down to the other floors with my room key every time a family member was ready to come up to my room, so my phone was ringing nonstop. It was a huge hassle and I very much regretted choosing Belvoir during both nights of my stay. Also, the shuttle that I arranged to come pick up guests from the venue at midnight went to the front entrance, but everyone was expecting it at the back entrance (where it had earlier dropped them off), so everyone missed the midnight shuttle and had to wait outside for almost an hour for it to come back. This was all extra stress that I did NOT need on my wedding weekend.</td></tr>

The trash was not emptied daily even when overflowing. The coffee and tea were not replenished unless specifically requested. The housekeeping was not what I would expect from a Belvoir. They just did the least amount possible that they could get away with. They even fought with us when we asked for an additional comforter giving us the third degree about why we needed one and what we were going to use it for. We brought the issues to the attention of the housekeeping managers who apologized but the fact that the room was not cleaned daily makes me question returning to this hotel the next time we are in NYC. The housekeeping service was not what one expects from a Belvoir hotel and certainly detracted from our stay.</td></tr>

Also, we reserved a deluxe room which should have had a microwave and fridge. When we checked in, we were told they would have to bring those items to us, as they were out of the rooms. Fine. After my second phone call, they brought the fridge, but not the microwave. I called about that, but it was never brought and we gave up hope for it.

There were other problems with the room. The light switch at the room entry only lights the entryway. There was no light to see the switches to the other lights, so I had to grope in the dark, not a very safe practice. The bulb in the desk lamp was burned out. The desk was too tall relative to the chair height. I had to reach up to use my computer or write (and Im 5-10 tall). This was neither comfortable nor ergonomic. They tried to deliver a package to my room at 10:30 p.m., after I had gone to bed. On a minor note, the coffee service tray was incomplete on the first night.</td></tr>

The staff at the front desk were very busy; however they greeted you in a very professional and courteous manner. The valet attendents were also first-rate. They were energenic and courteous. Overall I would have to say this facility provided us with a wonderful mini vacation that was more than we expected. We will definitely consider this again; hopefully in the near future.</td></tr>

Check-in was efficient and quick, the staff as a whole was friendly - there were 2 issues on the day of departure that I brought to the staff's attention; 1-a young child was left unattended by the pool area, he entered the hot tub and claimed to have urinated in it to one of his siblings, 2-within 10 minutes by the pool area, several (4+) LARGE (@2 inches long) bugs were found by/in the pool. I understand that issue 1 is beyond staff control in as far as they can not be responsible for another's actions esp. that of a child, but it can/should be monitored by making sure children are supervised by adults. I informed the desk of the issues and received a blanket statement that "it has been noted and the proper staff members will be informed" I LOVE the location of the hotel for the activities attended, bc of health issues during the summer, I can not be exposed to long periods of heat and to be able to watch the fireworks with my family from the comfort of our hotel and a/c is WONDERFUL and to be able to attend the Fair all day and not have to drive is a PLUS. I'm torn in regards to next years adventure because of the advantages of it's location but still have thoughts of the bugs in my mind and the little boys comment of urinating in the hot tub...</td></tr>

We are in our mid twenties and worried that the hotel would be too family oriented; however, that was not true. Yes, the resort had plenty of entertainment and fun for families (so, if you have a family, it will be great!), but it was also well suited for any other age. There is something for everyone. Our room was the lowest possible rate to be booked, and it was still phenomenal. The bed was unreal, and the room had plenty of space. The pools were fun and well maintained. All of the food onsite was awesome, and the staff was fantastic. The poolside bar was so convenient. The food was great, and the servers were excellent. Overall, the hotel staff was more than accommodating. The location was also great. This is one of the only properties in the area that is actually beach front. The hotel is far enough away from the crowds to be quiet and nice, but it is also close enough to walk to shops, restaurants, and more. I would highly recommend this hotel. It was honestly much better than I ever could have imagined. I can't wait to go back.</td></tr>

The lobby of the hotel is very nice, however I felt like I was checking in at a Las Vegas strip hotel because of the check-in line. Unfortunately, the rooms don't reflect what you see in the lobby. They are clean, but rather old and in need of updating. The bathroom fixtures for example looked like they were from the early 80's. None of this would have mattered much to me except when I woke up to get ready for my meeting the next morning, the water was completely off in the South Tower. Unfortunately, I had to attend the business meeting without the benefit of a clean, hygienic body and mouth. It was pretty disgusting. After the meeting, the water was turned back on and I was able to shower, pack, and check-out. The check-out girl managed to comp my coworker's wifi service for the night for her troubles, however, I hadn't purchased wifi and she indicated she was not able to comp anything on my bill. She did indicate she would award me additional Grandbourne points, but I never received them. This is why I'm writing this review.

Property is nothing overly special as it relates to convention center hotels. Carpets are far, far, far past needing to be replaced. Rooms are average size.

I was not impressed with the Housekeeping as I saw the same debris on my bathroom floor the day that I arrived until the day I checked out...5 nights later...which indicates they do no sweep. Staff could not be nicer. My expectations were high because I am BPG Gold. However, since I was in town with a convention, that didn't seem to mean much to anyone. I was able to at least get the extended check out.</td></tr>

RE: pool...apparently they sell local memberships to the pool and exercise facilities. as paying guests, we were unable to enjoy the pool and my guess is that non-guests with memberships were part of the reason for the overcrowding. seems Belvoir has to decide whethere they want to market themselves as high-end guest-oriented experience or LA Fitness experienc.</td></tr>

The shower was broken the whole time, couldn't get the shower switch to engage the full way, so half came out the shower and half out the shower head, also no hot water, luke warm water the whole time we were there. I have been to almost all the hotels in that area and this falls below lots of others around there. The view is very nice of the Navy base and downtown SD. You also get all the noise from the helicopters until about 9pm during the weekdays. Only one on the staff that was nice was Dave the Bellman. The valet staff was very rude, took my keys and then when they found out i would be self parking the park my truck in the sun and wouldn't have anything to do with me. The cleaning staff ignored our requests and the people up front at the desk gave the appearance of caring but had no followup on the room. Prices were comparable to other hotels. Swimming pools were very crowded with lots of families and drunks, maybe it was just that time of day, but i went back several times through out my stay and always the same. Also the TV would keep going out and having no signal at night. Good place to drop your bags and go see the rest of SD. Wouldn't recommend it.</td></tr>

Some time later a service person came to tidy up but all she did was compress garbage in can:there was still not room to put anything more in.

It appeared to be a cheap knock off of some type of memory foam gone bad. It was the most uncomfortable mattress I'd ever tried to sleep on. It offered absolutely no support. I sank in the bed to the point where I swear I could feel the box spring below.Needless to say I ended up sleeping on the couch.The next morning we were offered another room. While the next bed was slightly better another night of sleep depravation was in store for me.Needless to say if you have back problems as I do this hotel would not be for you.</td></tr>

The safe should be upgraded to digital. Who wants to carry such an awkward styled safe key around. Many times I found no signal for the TV -- it came and went. The hallway was always cluttered with room service trays, extra beds, and loud people. Evidently, there is no soundproofing applied between the hallway and guestrooms. I did leave an item in the room when checking out and never received an email even though you have it. Eating options close to the hotel are limited and many close supper early because the businesses in the area are closed for the evening/weekend.</td></tr>

Also, the 2% milk was also all gone and she refilled it after bringing it to her attention. Obviously, the attendants are not doing their job.</td></tr>

It's crazy that they gave me a key to get in, but I went to the front desk to tell them. They apologized and gave me a different room. The new room was fine, but Wifi was up for a very short time and then there was no access. I told the front desk and they said that they couldn't figure out what the problem was. I waited a few hours and tried again, but no luck. I tried to use the computers in the lobby to get onto Skype, but it's not accessible there. I called the front desk and they said that there are some rooms that have Internet access and some rooms that don't, but they're working on it. I told them that my fiance is in Afghanistan and we would like to be able to communicate.They said that I could use a computer in the lobby and use Skype. I told them that I had already tried that and am not able to access Skype from there. I mentioned my fiance and the front desk person said that he would immediately look into it and would call me right back. He never called and I was unable to get Internet access.

Paid for the upgrade for the ocean view and having the balcony was awesome. The suite was plenty big for 2 people and could easily accommodate a couple of kids. Lots of storage and very comfortable. Hotel runs a shuttle every half hour to and from the infamous downtown area so no need to drive! I work out religiously so the fitness center was important and while they had great equipment, they kept the temperature way to warm, often no towels available and there were no restrictions on children coming in. This was a problem as everytime I went to work out, a couple of mother's brought their young children in who basically ran amuck! A little issue with the hotel staff not changing our reservation to extend our stay one day but corrected once pointed out. Also, checked in early only to find out that previous guests had not yet checked out! Staff was friendly and generally accommodating.</td></tr>

I was told that rooms are not made available until 3:00 pm and was forced to sit in the lobby for over an hour. I certainly understand that some rooms may not be ready, but all of them? Really? By 1:30 none of the rooms had been cleaned? Then I find that the hotel charges for Internet access when my reservation clearly states free Internet. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk clerk, I was told it was my booking agents error and I was lucky they were honoring the rate provided. Although the hotel is clean and comfortable, a business is only as good as their employees. In this case, that really doesn't say much. I truly think the staff need to pick up a dictionary and read the definition of customer service. Rude lip service that fails to correct a problem is not customer service.</td></tr>

The plus: nice view, access to the club lounge (*Very* nice). Wish I'd had more time to use the gym, which looked fabulous. Food (I was there for a conference so ate a lot of meals at the hotel) was decent. All staff were polite, professional, and helpful. Fantastic location near the water and Pike's Market and other destinations. Overall, enjoyed my experience -but next time might prefer to stick with the original (bed only) room!</td></tr>

The front desk said that the lounge was closed on the weekends. There was nothing on the confirmation and nothing on the website when I made the reservation to indicate this was the case. The front desk said they were sorry. That was it! I asked for a rate reduction and they said no. The club rate did not include parking and wifi, which are charged as a package. This experience was very unsatisfactory. The hotel had been remodeled and the room was spacious and clean. The room had a view of the garbage dumpters and HVAC units both of which were very loud inlcuding garbage collection at 5 am on Saturday am. The public areas were dirty (a dirty spill in the elevator that was there the entire weekend and every glass door had numerous dirty fingerprints). We were not able to use the pool but it was very crowded with not a single open chair. The proximity to Stanford was a plus.</td></tr>

After crawling around to seeing if I could find connection problems (unsuccessfully), I decided to call the desk or housekeeping to report the problem. The phone was also not working! By them I had to depart for an appointment and reported the problems to the front desk. By the time I returned late that evening, the problems had been solved. The next morning, I went down to the hotel exercise facility (it is great!) and after the workout I found that my room key would not permit access to the 15th floor (my room was 1566). I went to the desk and was told that the magnetic striip was the likely problem and a new key was made. HOWEVER, since I did not take ID with me to the gym, I had to wait for security reasons to be escorted to my room. The desk clerk called for assistance and I/we waited a full ten minutes or more before someone finally responded. Once we got to the room, he just opened the door and let me in without any check of credentials so I don't see the point of a security escort. The upshot was that I was late for my first appointment that morning. This was unusual because I've always been very satisified with my Grandbourne experiences, but this was definitely a disappointment.</td></tr>

When we went to sleep, the bed comforter smelled like body odor (pungent) and we had to put it away. I believe that the Hotel was fully booked and they might have slacked on the Job a bit.

We arrived at the Hotel at 3pm and were told the room was not ready to come back at 4pm. We left to eat an early dinner, and returned to the hotel at 5pm only to be told our rooms were still not ready, (the concert start time was 4:30pm.) I was told because my reservation had a "special request" that was why our rooms weren't ready. My "special request" was to try to put our 2-rooms on the same floor and close together if possible, how dare I want to be near our guests! Also, I was told they didn't expect to be so busy due to the concert. (?) I thought that's why we need to make reservations. The gave us 2-rooms on separate floors and we took room 140. 7:30am I kept hearing a door slam and was sure our room was near the ice machine or a guest kept opening and slamming their door. Nope, every room door slams shut if you don't hold it and gently close it. So if you want to sleep in don't stay at this hotel or near room 140. Oh and the tub didn't drain, had to stand in bath water while showering. I NEVER do reviews, but I felt the need to share my experience because I read reviews to help me determine if I want to stay at a hotel. The grounds are beautiful :)</td></tr>

The staff are courteous as always. The updated room gives a more "clean" feel. The pool is narrow; we much prefer the former meandering pool, though the covered pavilion provides shades for those not wishing to be in the sun - something lacking previously. The main disappointment and dark spot of this stay was our experience with breakfast at Aqua Vi. We (party of 3 adults and 2 children) were made to wait about 40-45 minutes before we were seated. I noticed quite a few people arriving after us were seated before us. I enquired with the hostess and was told they are part of a wedding party of 25 who had reservation and that we will have a table soon. Fine. Meanwhile, the waiting room was cleared and only a few guest waiting. There comes a family of 4, unrelated to the wedding party, and they were seated within 5 minutes wait. Another family of 4 were seated right away upon arrival. I enquired again and complained. The hostess mentioned that she did not know that my party included 2 children. This is not good an explanation. COMMON SENSE should have prevailed that we have been waiting for 3/4 hour already and hence that everything should be done to accommodate our group, either to add another chair to a table or to join 2 tables together. But it never occurred to the hostess that there should be some parity and fairness, its 45 minutes versus 0 wait just because of 1 person. I wondered whether she would have kept us waiting had another family of 4 appeared, and until a table of "5" is freed. In the end, we were given a booth which is not even for 5 as one had to move out of the seat for the person inside to come out. I would not have cared for this had we been seated in the appropriate waiting time. I hope our situation is not repeated and that the hostess will look outside of the box.</td></tr>

We discovered this on the day we checked out and received our bill.The entire hotel desperately needs updating. Our room was on the pool level with a pool view. Every time a guest moved a chair at the pool it was extremely loud in our room. The room was warm and even though we adjusted the air it did not cool down. We asked for a 7:45 wake up call on the morning of the funeral but instead received a 5:45 wake up call. We then had to call back again to request another wake up call so that we wouldn't oversleep. The following morning we wanted to sleep in because we were exhausted so we did not request a wake up call but received one at 7:45 and could not go back to sleep. The pool was absolutely disgusting. The color was off, you could not see the bottom of the pool and there was hair all in the pool. There was nothing "nice" about the pool area either, only the view. You could hear a lot of hall noise in our room. The bathroom layout was small and the toilet is literally underneath the counter. Awful hotel and WAY over priced. Many nicer hotels to choose from in the area. Made a very difficult time even worse for us. Very disappointed.</td></tr>

There was a wedding that night and our room must have been right over or near the ballroom. The noise was so loud from the music and guests, that our room was literally vibrating. This went on from 9:30 pm to 11:45. Needless to say we couldn't sleep - and it sure wasn't romantic. We called the desk and complained. They said it would be ending at 11 pm (not true) and said they'd have security quiet it down (didn't happen - it got even louder). The next morning we complained about this. The front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. They were apologetic, knew about the problem, offered to buy us breakfast, gave us Grandbourne points, etc. There can always be a problem, but if the management accepts responsibility and makes it up to you - that really saves the day. So I think Belvoir should do two things. Says thanks to their front desk staff for a job well done - and soundproof their ballrooms. No guest should every have to lose sleep because of too much noise in the hotel.</td></tr>

The floor was extremely dirty and needed to be clean. The floor was so dirty until the white socks I was wearing were filled with dirt. I stayed on the club level and the food was dry and not fresh at all. I was suppose to stay two nights but after arriving and checking in to my room, I could not bear another night at the hotel. So I checked out after the one night stay moved to another BPG 25 min away. Finally, this hotel is very dull and old and it's in desperate need of a major renovation. For the amount of money I paid for the one night was not worth. I understand that Belvoir has been around for long time. But this hotel look like it was the first one built and there has not been any change except for the 40 inch flat screen tv on the wall. I highly recommend this hotel being torned down and rebuilt and this will bring new life to the Midlothian area and I am sure the residence in the area will appreciate it. Therefore, until changes are made short pump will be the area that I will stay in when I visit Richmond.</td></tr>

We have stayed in this resort a couple of times and are Grandbourne Preferred Guests. As we walked into our room, we were greeted with a garbage full of beer bottles, a kitchen full of dirty dishes and the refrigerator wide open. It looked like the room had never been cleaned, and that a party had just recently ended. We made our way to the master bedroom to find a bed that looked like it was just laid in, and a bathroom with towels all over the floor, and all the complimentary soaps opened and used. The second bedroom was suppose to be two DOUBLE beds, and to our surprise was two TWIN beds, mind you we were four couples. What I found a little comical of all of this is that we called around 6:00pm to say we were running late and wouldn't be in until 11:00pm , and we were told your room is already clean and ready. I guess the Belvoir has different opinions of what constitute a CLEAN and READY room. We called management and were told someone would be right over, it took about 40 minutes for someone to come, this was already 1:00am. The supervisor didn't even bother looking at the condition of the room and simply stated he believed us, which leads me to believe this isn't the first time the Resort encounters this problem with a guest. They moved us to another room, and we were told that we would receive a $40 credit to use in the resort for our stay. When we got to the other room, again we were greeted with unmade beds, at this point we were tired and just wanted to sleep, so we just asked for clean sheets, the supervisors response was "look in the closet", clean sheets were never brought to us. We decided to go and use our $40.00 credit at the supermarket located inside the resort, much to our surprise, there was NO CREDIT TO USE! the overnight supervisor never notated the account with the credit, and forgot to mention why we requested a room change. We decided that we had enough of the resort and went to the front desk to ask for a credit of $40.00 back to our credit card. Again, we were greeted by unfriendly staff, unwilling to help. We were told that they could not do anything for us and that a credit to our account was illegal, mind you we reserved our stay directly with the hotel, I would understand if we booked with a third party. After about an hour of arguing with management we were given a $40.00 credit towards our credit card. I am sorry, but after all the problems we had with the resort, I sincerely though management would have offered a little more then the initial $40.00 credit were we offered for a DIRTY, UNKEPT, SMELLY, room and UNFRIENDLY, UNHELPFUL employees. I visit Orlando on a constant basis and have stayed at the Belvoir several times. Unfortunately our next stay in Orlando will NOT be at the Belvoir Vistana Resort. This is not the service you expect from such a large hotel chain, it's not like we paid $40 a night, we paid $212 a night (with taxes) for horrible service, and an initial dirty, unkept, smelly room, with dirty sheets. I would never recommend this resort to a family member, friend, colleague, or random passer by. This was the worst hotel experience my family and I have ever had.</td></tr>

He said that it looks like they put me down for 2 reservations for a room for one of the nights by accident and charged me for a no show. Honestly the first time I have heard of charging for a no show, especially on a weekday. He said it would be refunded that day. 2 weeks have gone by without seeing it yet and being sent to voicemail yet again. You might want to think twice about staying here.

After a day of delays we arrived at the hotel at 9 p.m. (in my mind I was thinking all we need to do is take a shower and hurry up to make it to our event) and the hotel staff tells me the hotel is overbooked and there is no room for us. Their alternative is to send us to another hotel 15 miles away in La Jolla. By the time we got to the other hotel and checked in it was past 11 p.m. The whole point of us going to San Diego was to enjoy and have fun . This experience was anything but that. The hotel overbooks and we end up losing. We didn't make it to our event that night because it was a 30 minute taxi ride back to San Diego and another 30 minute taxi ride back to the hotel. We ended up calling it a night after realizing that by the time we would get back to San Diego we would be to late for our event. This disrupted our travel plans and made us miss the reason we were going to San Diego. This is unprofessional and should not happen. I booked this hotel because we wanted to visit San Diego not La Jolla.</td></tr>

The rooms were bright and clean, although the bathroom was quite small. Our two small boys thoroughly enjoyed the pools and the water slide -- well done! We ordered food three times during our stay and every meal was very good. We were also pleasantly surprised with the entertainment options for both kids and adults - the movie by the pool at night was a great touch. But there were two things we felt really detracted from the "upgraded" persona of this hotel -- #1: While the staff were always friendly and happy to help, there were just too few working the pool bar. Every time we went for a drink or to place a food order, it was a long wait and they just seemed to be always running around. And getting anyone to take your order while lounging at the pool was an impossibility - a real challenge for parents with two small children. Secondly, while the idea of the poolside movie after dark is great, we think the hotel really should have invested in double paned windows for the pool facing rooms. Our two small kids couldn't fall asleep until well after 10:00pm with all the noise.</td></tr>

We told him we were disapointed and he tried to get us into a suite with queen beds. There was none available for Friday and Saturday night, but we did get to switch to the suite on Sunday6 evening.

This property really recognizes their platinum members, we received an upgraded room/suite, which was spacious with beautiful views of Diamond Head, the ocean and property. Platinum members also received a wristband that allowed easier access to the new club lounge & getting towels at the pool. The new lounge on the 30th floor was great, the hostess and wait staff very friendly and helped with island recommendations/directions. Club lounge had great choices for breakfast and evening appetizers. Pool areas were great for families with a water slide and we never had a problem locating chairs by the pool or space on the beach. Overall a nice hotel, great location, and friendly service. Thanks for honoring platinum status...as not all Grandbourne hotels do. Highly professional, courteous and efficient management (Thanks Kelly and Julie). Anytime we are back in Honolulu, this will be where we stay!</td></tr>

All the furniture must be from the 80's. It was all dinged up. They still have popcorn ceilings for crying out loud. The bathroom is in need of serious upgrades. When we checked in the staff was pleasant enough, however when we requested a late check out for 4 pm (as per our status when available) they said they could not accommodate. We told them our situation as we have 2 children under the age of 2 that needed a nap before an evening wedding, the best they could do was 2 pm which we were very upset about. This caused our kids to not be rested and we had to leave the wedding early. We didn't make it out of our room until 230 (we were rushing) and nobody had even come to clean it yet so we know they could have extended it for us, they just didn't want to go above and beyond. When we went to give our son a bath there was hair in the bath tub which was just gross and not what you want to see before bathing your child. The one thing that was very nice was their breakfast buffet. I would highly recommend that. Valet was good but took a little long. Overall we were disappointed and will stay at the Westin like we have in the past in San Diego.</td></tr>

Upon check-out a later check out could not be provided as they were sold out (not surprising) however the staff allowed us use of a hospitality suite for 30 mins later in the day so we could clean up after spending the day on the grounds and in the pools. With such a late flight, this feature was very much appreciated. Food was also outstanding!

We were both very happy that it worked out this way. We stayed at a different property for 2 subsequent nights and much preferred the Belvoir. We stayed in an ocean view suite that was clean, comfortable and spacious. The front desk staff was very courteous and helpful. Christopher at the pool was very friendly and fun to talk to. Our service at the bar, pool and restaurant was great, too. The grounds were nice but not overly clean. I wouldn't say dirty, but I didn't notice much attention to detail, i.e. cigarettes, leaves, etc. The pool was very nice and very family friendly. We've been to a lot of places with our kids and it seems there's often pool police yelling at people for having fun. Here, everyone was having fun in a safe and controlled way. I saw Christopher address 2 guests very discreetly, one for smoking a cigarette and one for drinking what was presumably her own alcoholic concoction out of a red cup. He simply asked her to put it in a clear cup from the bar. Very reasonable! The shuttle worked well for us but I overheard a lot of complaints. You are required to book early and if it books up you are out of luck. The van only seats around 12 people. It seems like they could have either more vans or a larger bus-type vehicle. Ed was a great driver. He was very fun to talk to and helpful with suggestions and directions. I would definitely recommend this property. We will be bringing our kids back next spring.</td></tr>

The beach and pool are amazing and when combined with the bar and lunch areas make for a fun filled day. With the age of the hotel, one might think that it would desperately need renovations. But I have always found that it has undergone many face-lifts to keep up with the times and quality you would expect and desire in your stay on Sand Key Beach. I would and have always referred this hotel to all my friends and family and would without hesitation to a stranger. The location is also a tremendous plus, It's location has the feeling of seclusion while also being moments from fast paced stretch of Clearwater Beach. I have always enjoyed my extended stays and short visits and look forward to my next! You will not find better accomodations or location anywhere on the Gulf side of Florida! Do yourself and family a favor and book your next visit to the area- at the Belvoir Sand Key.</td></tr>

The bathroom was one area that I thought was lacking. Our room, #816, had a tiny bathroom. Barely enough space in there to turn around. We've stayed at this hotel before, and I can't remember the bath in the room we had being as small as this one. Which leads me to another complaint. We are BPG gold members, and the staff said they upgraded us to a deluxe room, but with the small bathroom, it really didn't seem like an upgrade.

Upon arriving we were incredibly excited and shocked to see how nice this resort was. It is beautiful and very well maintained. We checked-in in about 5 minutes and were led to the concierge who was amazing. She gave us basic welcome information, some coupons for local restaurants and a sheet for all the times for the shuttle to Disney World. The next morning we arrived to wait for the shuttle with about 20 other people. However, the shuttle was over 20 minutes late picking us up. They said it was a fluke so we ignored it and had a great day at Magic Kingdom. That night, we went to the bus stop to be picked up by the bus to get back to the hotel. This time, the bus was over 30 minutes late. We got back to the hotel and I decided to call and ask if there were any other ways of getting to Disney besides the bus since we were only in Orlando for Disney. When I called, the lady very rudely told me that no one ever complains about the bus, and that the only other way to get to Disney would be a Taxi and that would be very expensive. She then said the bus was always on time. The bus was late every evening picking us up, at least by 15 minutes. One time, it even came to the wrong bus stop and almost left 20 people stranded at Disney World. I know this sounds like a review for the bus service, but the Belvoir hires them and refuses to help fix it. We left a message with the Manager so hopefully it will be fixed in the future. But after this experience, we won't be staying here again.</td></tr>

That said, the location -- right by the Disney Boardwalk -- provides convenient water taxi access to Epcot. Minor inconvenience related to check-in: was issued door-lock cards that would not open assigned room. Upon returning to reception desk discovered that incorrect dates had been written to card (had put first day's date as the checkout date) and new cards were issued. Room was relatively large and had a separate desk workspace. Hotel lobby, function space, and exterior were very well maintained; room furnishings less so. Housekeeping was generally OK; minor incidents: one day hadn't made up room by 4PM so needed to call, another day toiletries hadn't been restocked. Fitness center was nice and access was included in resort fee. Bottom line: this is a fine place to stay if you are attending a convention or other business event here and not desiring a more upscale experience.</td></tr>

We didn't opt for any of the buffets ( which looked very tempting) yet stuck with menu items, and were more than pleased!! Martin was an amazing server and took very good care of us. All hotel staff was very helpful although the bar near the pool seemed as if their staff was on it's own time and even though they were not busy would stand around before even acknowledging you were there. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.We will definitely be returning.</td></tr>

We needed extra towels and called the request in to hotel services. Two hours later, we walked down to the lobby to get our own towels. My husband needed some bottled water during the night and several of the vending machines (on different floors) were out of bottled water. The next morning, we went to the concierge to pick up some items and waited over 10 minutes before someone could get to us and then they did not help us. In frustration, we left our items on the counter and walked away. Customer service was NOT a priority on this weekend.</td></tr>

I told them that I couldn't even get a cup of coffee and it said snacks were provided all day. They told me it had been very busy and food would arrive at the cocktail hour. Now the same snacks that had been there the day before were being sold to a dance competition. I suspect they were using the product from the concierge for that. I was pretty much dismissed. I do know that the employee that was working the room the most had to cover another employees schedule because they had called in.

Once we got into our connecting rooms and began to get comfy, it suddenly became VERY clear that there was a man in my bed who did not clean up after himself, nor was he cleaned up after. We were then given free this, waived fee that, free this, waived fee that, but it just doesn't seem like enough.

All very courteous and they even offer you a bottle of cold water for take in the car to cool off. Overall great staff. My only critique was going to the bar when the restaurant was closed and they didn't have an expresso machine or even a regular coffee machine to resolve it quickly. The barman was very nice but he had to go to another floor to ask someone else to make it and after about 20 minutes came with coffee. I don't know if it's a concession or hotel managed, but in this day and age a bar like that should have an expresso machine or at minimum regular coffee avialbel at all times during the day. Ironically, while I was checking out another person came up to the front desk asking where they could get a cup of coffee. By the way, there is an individual coffee machine and free coffee in the rooms, but, just like me , some people want to meet with others at the bar not in the room. Other than that, overall great experience and great hotel if you want to stay near the airport.</td></tr>

They were truly superb and this is coming from someone that has now become tainted and jaded when it comes to guest services. I am so very glad to have taken a few days to reminisce about the 25 years my family and I vacationed there at your hotel. I now have one more wonderful memory to add to it! I truly wish to thank the entire staff there at the Belvoir Universal and cannot wait to visit in the very near future. Thank you so very much to you all!</td></tr>

If you are going to have a coffee pot in the room make sure it is stocked. I wasn't dare going to walk and get some cream and sugar i was afraid I would get lost. All of these factors I could have handled. Actually, the bed felt fantastic and I think I had the best sleep I have had in a hotel. BUT when pulling up the covers in the morning I was shocked to find what was on the sheets. I will not mention here because I don't want to embaras.

We asked if the shuttle would take us a short distance to a nearby restaurant, (my husband uses a walker) We were told the shuttle doesn't go in that direction and take a cab. The cab driver was unhappy as it wasn't a long drive, but he did take us. After dinner we waited 45 minutes for a cab. In the meantime the Hilton shuttle picked up several guests to take them back to their hotel. Unfortunately this experience put a blemish on what would have been a perfect stay.

The fellow offered me my gift but never bothered to have it sent up to the room. When I called down 3 hours later, he acted like I made the mistake. Further the club room was the WORST club room I have ever seen. The quality of the food was similar to a public school canteen. In the morning when I went there, the coffee machine was in need of service so I brought it to the attention of the morning attendant who was only concerned with my not having shoes on. He let me know, and everyone in the room (which was packed with families) that I was in violation of the health code which would get him shut down. As I was leaving the room he did his level best to share loudly that I could come back once I put shoes on or even some flip flops as thought I didn't understand what shoes or foot covering might be.</td></tr>

How is this an upgrade?? I have no view, no balcony and I could never get my luggage up all those stairs..oh sorry thats all we have I can give you some BPG points and $100 off... at this point fine I'm really tired...even more tired after I didn't sleep..on the top of the hotel you hear the trains!!! a lot!!! and didn't think about it but I purposely booked a room without a kitchenette because they make me nervous (had hotels with cockroaches) - sorry you didn't enjoy your stay but it was an upgrade I can't offer you any more --- needless to say I WILL NEVER BE BACK - property and cleanliness of rooms is also way below par for a Belvoir since last time I was here...all leaves on property guaranteed are from winter and this is July...and if you want to keep your meal in your stomach don't look at the corners or in the vents by the windows in the restaurant I think the dust has been collecting since they opened.>!</td></tr>

This to me is pretty inexcusable. I understand hearing noisy neighbors who are rowdy and drunk, but this was normal noise that I could hear as if they were in my room with me! I also requested an ocean view upgrade, which was granted (partially). We were on the fourth floor and could hear everything going on in the pool, so I requested another room, which they couldnt accomodate. That was fine as the pool noise wasn't so bad but the club music going on til about 1 in the morning Saturday night was pretty dissapointing as well, especially because I had already requested to be higher up to avoid this but could not be accomodated. I believe that your hotel is nice, but if you want us to be "wowed" by something other than the lobby, invest in some non-connected rooms with thicker walls so that other guests can enjoy their privacy and sleep when their neighbors are conversating, packing, or even changing clothes.

The maintenance man came immediately, but it was a little disconcerting to see him literally break down the door to get into our room. Housekeeping staff seemed to congregate outside of our room, which was at the very end of the hallway. They were so unbelievably loud that I had to wear earphones and use a white noise app on my phone just to study. They also failed to replace hand towels and a bathmat. Finally, on the first night we ordered room service. We ordered a club sandwich, but the server brought a Caesar salad, then looked at me incredulously when I told him the order was incorrect. He finally brought the sandwich, but the order was still wrong. We asked for no mayo, but it was slathered in mayo and it came with fruit instead of fries. I caught the server in the hallway and let him know it was still incorrect but he never returned with the correct order. Since we had to be up at the crack of dawn for the most important test of our lives, we gave up and went to bed.</td></tr>

Both balconies were dirty, I don't think they mop balconies at all. Big problem with me I got two babies. Telephone receiver still had make up and oil from previous guest on it. Carpet around ice box was wet, drinking glasses had water stains on it. We called front desk they had supervisor from housekeeping come up and check it out. She did apologize however, she never checked to see if issues we resolved. Ice box still leaked because door did not shut good. Had to put babies antibiotics on ice to keep cold. Glasses we never replaced, balconies were not left any better then they were before. If it wasn't for the pools the entire stay would have been a disaster. I do believe in the saying, "you get what you pay for", but this was a huge disapointment, To top it off, at check out we were not ever asked how was our stay. I think this hotel is into mass production, getting people in and out. No personalization at all. Awe! as say in Hawaii</td></tr>

The pink/red mold on the shower curtain was clearly visible so not sure why those aren't replaced regularly by housekeeping. Surely it can be seen and smelled. Other than that, this particular hotel location worked out great for us as the shuttle ride to the airport was less than 5 minutes.</td></tr>

The hotel was immaculate and the staff were truly helpful. My criticisms are that the room was a bit noisy and not as cool as I would have liked. I was in Room 130 - which is rather convenient being on the main floor but it was located by the security door and its adjacent ice machine room. There was a lot of coming and going that was quite audible in the room. It should also be noted that rooms on this side of the first floor are bi-level rooms. Enter on one level with closet and bathroom and then descend 5 steps to the bed area. While it make for a bigger room - mostly because of tall ceilings - the arrangement of the furniture that would have been fine for a normal sized room -seemed a little lost in this space. The plus side of this room was the patio outside that was great for coffee in the AM. Because of the larger size of the room, the AC (which could not be set below 70) could not really keep up with the heat and cycled on and off on a regular basis. Despite these points, I would stay here again just not on this floor.</td></tr>

If you do, the rooms are very small for three or more people to stay in. The check-in lines are long and slow. What takes them so long to check people in? Seems like they are doing all kinds of typing and clicking and looking and searching and whatever it is they are doing. Should be easier and simple. I stood in a line of about 10 people checking in and had to wait over 20 minutes before I got to the front of the line. Luckily, I got there when I did as a bunch of people showed up after me and waited way longer. There was only three people working check-in and one guy in the corner working on a computer but not helping anyone. People in line were not very happy. The best part of the hotel is location, especially if you are going to the Times Square area. It is easy to get to lots of places from here walking. Easy to get a cab and friendly doormen. I stay here only when I need to be close to Times Square. Otherwise, there are way better choices. Oh, and no free wifi. What are they thinking? Just makes people mad.</td></tr>
