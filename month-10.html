A number of people came down to get dinner/drinks and watch football. There was only one member on staff and he was clearly overwhelmed. I also ordered the Skirt Steak Chimichurri off of the menu. I have been a chef and know cuts of meat and what I received was not skirt steak. The meal was disappointing from that aspect.</td></tr>

Also, It seemed that many people not staying at club level were accessing the lounge and carting away food. The hotel is a very good mid-level choice.

All that being said I will NEVER stay at this hotel again unless God forbid its the only option, then I will dread every moment leading to the stay. I booked a room at this hotel for 4 nights. At check in I was thanked for my platinum status but not offered a welcome gift, (points, etc.) and I was told we were in a room with a double bed. I was traveling with my wife, kids stayed home, so I asked for a king bed. The staff looked at the computer and said "I am sorry sir, but our king rooms are totally sold out for the entire length of your stay I found this hard to believe so I asked, are you sure? "Yes sir, totally booked so I pulled up my BPG mobile app and checked, there are all kinds of king rooms available. I show the gentleman what about all these king rooms, I can get online and book one right now that is available. Now I am pretty calm, but I was pretty irritated that I had been lied to. The desk person says "let me check" goes back behind the check in wall and comes back and says "we can put you in a king room Honestly? After all that? Most hotels make me feel like staying exclusively at Grandbourne properties is a good idea and take care of us; The Belvoir downtown Seattle always, Always makes me regret it.

There were no "Club Level" rooms available, but I was given club access on my key, which was certainly just as good (Club access gets you complimentary breakfast, cocktail-hour snacks, and free beverages all day, in addition to access to a computer with printer -- perfect for checking in for your flight!). I was also given free Internet access in my room, and even two complimentary drink passes. (I was meant to be given one, but when I mentioned that I was there for a romantic weekend, the man the counter gave me two).</td></tr>

I would recommend this hotel simply because of its convenient location in my local airport, and the general comfort of the rooms. However, after a recent stay in which I left a personal item in the room, I had an experience of very bad customer service. First, I didn't receive even the courtesy of a return phone call after I left a detailed message for housekeeping a few hours after I checked out. When I gave up waiting and called again two days later and asked to speak to a "real person in housekeeping," I was promised that by the phone operator, but again put through somebody's voicemail. I drove 40 minutes back to the hotel, and when housekeeping looked for my item and couldn't find it, staff implied that I was mistaken that I'd left it there. When they finally located it, after my repeated insistance that they look in their lost and found "one more time," they came up with excuses instead of a simple apology. They were actually full of excuses, e.g. the reason I didn't get a call back in the first place was that the supervisor was off the day I left the message.</td></tr>

It was a very hot day and my room was very warm when went inside. I attempted to put the A/C on and found out by reading the manual in the room that it takes 15-20 minutes to kick in! So the room was very hot the whole time I was getting ready, which was a pain. Once I got back to the room later that night, it was a pleasant temperature b/c the A/C had been on. Some of these "green" measures are just plain silly and more of a nuisance than they were worth. Also the hallways of the hotel were very warm, which wasn't pleasant, and smelled like curry. The hotel is beautiful overall and well maintained. I would recommend changing the air conditioning system though. We ordered room service for breakfast the next morning and while everything was delicious, the portions were TINY. I got huevos rancheros and I think there were two tablespoons of black beans on the plate. If the hotel is going to charge room service prices, at least make the portions decent. Also, the hotel front desk staff wasn't very friendly and didn't seem anxious to get my room for me even though it was a VIP room.</td></tr>

The Front Desk area was loud and I could barely hear the woman who checked me in, due to excessive noise. I was put in a room on the 3rd floor and attached to a meeting room. The bathroom was dingy, paint peeling by the ceiling, with no washcloths. There was a broken thermostat on the wall and the room was too hot. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the only worthwhile aspect of the room. The wi-fi was additional fee and slow. I could hear people in the hallway, as if they were inside my room.

So I was tired and perhaps not very tolerant. Nevertheless, I was dismayed to find, after I had returned my rental car, that the hotel does not offer a shuttle service to and from the airport. The additional $45 for a taxi each way seemed like a significant extra expense I had not anticipated. Further, I found the room, though with ample space, to be poorly lit and with a fairly antiquated air conditioning system. There was someone else's hair on the bedroom vanity. The bathroom was small with only a standard residential bathtub (with a drain plug that would not stay open for the use of the shower). The decor of the room seemed outdated to me. When I called to report that I could not access my room because my key cards would not work, I was placed on hold, after which I was told someone would come to help me. When this person arrived, he tested my keycards himself (as if I was mistaken), then asked to see my identification before opening my door for me. He then said that I would have to take my keycards back down to the front desk to have them fixed. I agreed to the terms and fee to access the wireless internet but after returning from having the keycards fixed, the internet was no longer available. I called for help and was transferred to tech support where I was on hold for about 10 minutes. As soon as someone came on the line, the internet modem showed up and I was able to log back on. I made 4 calls from my room to toll-free numbers, yet I was charged $2.29 for each of these toll-free calls. Perhaps because I was there over a Saturday night, at some time of the early evening, music could be heard in my room, coming from the courtyard side. I do not know the source.</td></tr>

The only thing that surprised me with this hotel is, it is offering some points in exchange of not making up the room. I want to be pampered when I travel so I want to see my bed made and clean towels are ready to be used and stock of amenities in the washroom. I appreciate when someone clean the bath tub and the toilet bowl for me. It is so tempting to accept the points but I would like to have the housekeepers keep their job. I would not trade the points for that. I AM EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED THAT Belvoir LOWER THEIR STANDARDS PROBABLY TO PLEASE OTHER PEOPLE TO COLLECT POINTS FASTER, BUT I AM NOT PLEASED AT ALL.</td></tr>

The counter where the TV sat had part of the lamination ripped off to reveal dirty cardboard and the edge had a cigarette burn. The carpet visibly needed to be vacuumed. I arrived after 1 AM so I sucked it up and went to sleep. I kept my clothes in my bag and was glad I did. Upon getting ready to depart a few days later I went looking for my belt in the dresser thinking one of my visiting grandchildren stuck it there and found and old cocktail glass full of fluid and mold in the drawer. Yikes! I quietly told the front desk when departing and the young lady didn't respond. Maybe she was too shocked or just didn't know what to say.</td></tr>

My biggest pet peeve with this hoel, and it will prbably prevent me from staying here again, is the bell desk. For some unknown reason they will not call cabs for you, but seem to have a network of their friends that they get to drive you ether in a 15 pax van, or in their personal vehicles, and it is always more expensive than taking a metered taxi. Having been taken for a ride before by this service, and really not liking not having a choice, I pushed a little harder for a metered taxi at which point the bell desk jut got rude with me. Again I consider this unacceptable for a Belvoir. I'm not sure what kind of kickback they are getting from these people in their own vehicles, but I feel like I am in some 3rd world country, not in the US.</td></tr>

I would say the overall amenities - even the snacks provided on the business level - were pretty sad. I think the whole place (except the staff) needs a makeover.</td></tr>

Also, ordered room service and after waiting 45 minutes I called back to be told that they forgot to get my name and room number so they did not cook it and the kitchen was now closed. The next morning I called to order coffee and the lady told me what room I was in and my last name and when I asked her how she knew she told me that name and room always show when you call room service and front desk. So, not too sure how the person the night before could claim they couldn't cook our food because they did not know what room or name. The only reason we stay here is because it is very convenient when going to the rangers games.(walking distance) However, the rooms are over priced and so is the food. The hotel is pet friendly which is great, however you can smell urine smells in the hallways and rooms. They need to reserve one area for people with pets. Carpets are also very dirty.</td></tr>

Its always taken me forever for check-in. Next, there is no follow-up. For e.g. I dialed "0" to mention I did not receive my bill and they said they would send it to my room right away. After 3 hours, still no bill and no one followed-up to see if I got my bill or not. Lastly the concierge definitely needs a lot of work.

She came up stairs with the Director of Maintenance who stated that they keep a record book and that it was changed recently. I stated that if it was changed recently then you have got huge problems with dirt and dust in this hotel because a filter does not get that dirty in a matter of a couple of months. It was so bad you could not even see through the filter when held up to the light. Anyway, they change the filter and dont offer me anything. So next I get settled and unpacked and try to use the internet, to my surprise the internet was not working. I called downstairs and was told they would call the technician to see what was going on. About 1 hour later still not working, just in my room, rest of the hotel was ok. So, they move me to another room. Now I have to get all of my belongings together and make the move. We check the internet and its ok. I get settled again, go to dinner come back and try to use the TV, the remote control does not work. I call back downstairs and they send a maintenance man up. He changes the batteries in the remote, then changes remotes all together. Now it works but you have to push the up down button at least twice to change the channel and same thing with the volume. We go back and forth with this and finally I had enough and tell him to leave, I will deal with it. I go to lie down in bed and now the remote will not work at all. The maintenance man comes back up and he gets it to work but he is standing up right in front of the TV. I tell him that it should work from lying down. He states to me no, thats the way it works. I must get up out of bed, stand in front of the TV to change the channel anytime I want to change the channel. This is now very comical, if this was not happening to me I would not belive it. The maintenance man actually said, You need to get up, stand in front of the TV every time you want to change the channel or move the volume I kid you not. I had enough of this guy, so I call downstairs and speak to a front desk clerk; I ask her does she think that I should have to do this every time I need to change the channel. She actually states to me sir, if thats what maintenance says then thats what you need to do I ask her, yes I know what they said but Im asking you does this sound right. She states yes. I have to give it to them, they all stick together, no matter how stupid they are.</td></tr>

When I opened the door, I found a mini-fridge sitting open with a big puddle in front of it. Also, I looked at the nightstand, and there was no alarm clock. Finally, I tried to plug in my phone to charge it, and the plugs in the desk didn't work (they were too loose to hold the plug). All of these problems were eventually fixed, but I have to wonder if the Housekeeping Supervisor or Assistant Manager have adequate room inspection procedures.

I requested room service on day one but declined day two and three to get the points voucher but they cleaned my room anyway and still did not get all the hair cleaned up. There were no filters for the coffee pot to make tea, the bottled waters in the room were not free and was not noted anywhere on the tags placed on the bottles you would be charged for them. Breakfast was rather pricey for an omlet (good flavor), toast and coffee for $25. I took a chance and ordered the same meal twice and had different food quality and presentation both times, unfortunately day two was worse than day one. The water main break was an inconvenience but happened at the most inopportune time for those of us who get ready between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning. The hotel manager did provide a letter of apology for the inconvenience but no room rate deduction or comps were given. The concierge on duty the evening of Oct 2 was not very helpful or resourceful in making reservations for our party of 8. I was able to find my own reservations using open table app on my Blackberry and turned out to be our best meal of the week! While the hotel itself is under renovation and offers a very nice atmosphere, the staff and management need to step up their game to offer the best in class serivce a hotel of their caliber and locale demand.</td></tr>

Rooms were clean but extremely out of date, peeling wallpaper, dripping shower head, water was cut off due to a burst pipe at the entire complex. The main hotel guests received notification, but the folks in the Bay Tower got no information and small plastic glasses of water to brush teeth and face. The overall hotel location was also poor, close to the airport with a free shuttle, but not close to any of the activities in Downtown San Diego, no shuttles provided - so you had to take a cab $15 - 20 each way. The only restaurant in the Bay Tower was overpriced and service was slow.</td></tr>

I discovered there was a Grandbourne guest floor accidentally. After arriiving at my room I found that it smelled of pets. I asked to be moved to a room in which pets were not allowed. I was placed on the Grandbourne guest floor at that point. When travelers like myself committ to a loyalty program it is disheartening to find out that the expected perks are not automatically provided. It is disappointing.</td></tr>

The pull out sofa was not clean - food particles & a dental floss device were clearly evident when the cushions were removed. The chair in the room was also stained & dirty. The bathroom cleanliness was also sub-par for a Belvoir. We requested 2 queen beds, but were told that only double beds came with this pkg. We were very disappointed & would have requested to speak to a mgr., but our flight left quite early & we needed to sleep. We were not sure how quickly our problem would have been addressed. We seem to think that we had a sub par room because we were only staying overnight.</td></tr>

We heard nothing else from guest services that evening, but at 8:30am the next morning, room service showed up with a tub of ice saying there were no extra refrigerators and ours could not be replaced!

However, there were a few problems with this hotel we hadn't encountered before. The first, the parking area is being used as a parking lot for off of property events. The area was coned so you had to drive behind the hotel (past the trash, etc...) to get to the front. Also the parking behind the hotel was so hap-hazard, we had to weave around parked cars to get through. Upon entering the lobby, there was a water dispenser (as it was 108 degress that day.) At 3PM, the dispenser was empty. At check in, we informed the lobby staff and they said they would take care of it. As we left for dinner at 6PM, the dispenser was still empty, the sliced orange still stuck in the same place on the side of the glass container. We stayed on the 5th floor and as we walked to our room, we couldn't notice how dirty the carpets were, you could see the paths to each of the doorways. Also there were scuff marks almost the entire length of the walls from either the maid carts or baggage carts being dragged along them. Finally upon checkout, we were unable to exit the driveway due to the parking lot issue. The exit gate was closed and the attendant told use to use our room key. When we told him we had just checked out and showed him our parking pass, we were told we had to go back to the front desk and get a card so we could exit. Upon returning to the front desk, they told me I had the parking pass and the parking attendant should have let us out. We returned to the gate and waited until the attendant returned who then let us out without an apology. Even with these issues the hotel room was clean and comfortable which is most important. We did bring these issues to the attention of the staff who responded with an "ok." This is a new hotel that gives the look of a much older property...</td></tr>

I stayed two nights and my room was not even cleaned between nights. When I called the front desk, I was asked to wait in the Club Lounge while this was being done, and after waiting an hour and a half, the room was still not cleaned. The Club Level did not have all days snacks as advertised and the nightly appetizers were mediocre at best. I was also unable to have breakfast either day as by the time I went to the Lounge, the buffet style set up was picked over and not refreshed or refilled at all. The room itself was nice enough but this experience quite simply was not what I paid for nor did it meet my expectations. I am very unlikely to stay at this hotel again in the future.</td></tr>

They then sprinted off and I was unable to find them since I had to get dressed. I would think that the do not disturb sign should be a pretty clear sign that you should not enter a room. It was quite a disappointing event and made my wife and I quite uneasy for the rest of the night at our dinner reservation and back to at the hotel. I was not going to even report this and was just not going to return to your hotel, but my friend is a platinum organizer status with star woods and told me that I should fill out an online review.

Plus, I've found that Belvoirs are usually quality hotels. This one is no exception. The hotel is very nice, the rooms are clean and pleasant, and the airport location is ideal for people arriving on very late flights. My only complaint was that the airconditioner in the room was extremely loud and kept cycling all night. Since it was too warm to turn the thing off, there was not much I could do about it except endure it and settle for a less than restful night's sleep. It always amazes me that otherwise quality hotels don't invest in quiet, central air conditioning systems.</td></tr>

I do wish the staff at the front desk were a bit more helpful, they assume you know where things are located. We were also not informed of the list of activities that are included in the $25 a day resort fee. Just "you know about the resort fee?" . I found the housekeeping staff to be more nicer, always saying aloha hand they see you in the hallway. The location is great. They changed their breakfast from buffet to sit-down "based on customer feedback" which is not that great because your options are so limited and if its not included in the packaged you chose, its can be very costly so you might as well eat somewhere else. Also the wait timr to be seating was crazy some days...up to 30 mins and them to get your food another 30 mins.</td></tr>

Both times I was put in a room overlooking air handlers and right next to the elevators. You can hear people using the elevator all morning which is frustrating when your sleeping. I requested on our second stay to avoid these locations but they did not acknowledge my request. The valet service was horrible. We called again and they were to busy to take us, told us to come down and it would take 10 mins. It took over 30 minutes and our friends that came later got their vehicle before ours. The first time we stayed we had a cake and they told us they would pick it up and leave in housekeeping fridge and bring a cutting knife, neither ever happened. This visit we also ate breakfast at the resort, they took forever to seat our large party even though the room was not full, ran out of plates and service took to long. Conserving the money for the hotel, extra fees and the money we spent in the hotel I would have expected better service.</td></tr>

No credit has been issued and no manager has called. I am not happy. Will not be staying here again.

Even though things were not going great I still went and asked to extend my stay one night, the "night manager" said she cannot see my rate so I would have to pay the rate which is going for that night, I'm fine with that except she LIED because when I checked out my rate was printed on the receipt!

The bathroom vanity was small and for ,again ,a person who is handicapped. NO ONE TOLD me that the room was not a regular room. I also thought the shower was quite dirty and not very nice for anyone to use. The phone in the girls room was broken. They were given a very sub-par room. The girls settled in with all their stuff before I could approve of the room and as they were17 we needed to have rooms that were connected by a door. When I asked for a discount (because we could not move) I was told "no". They did give me 1000 Grandbourne points - great points that don't get me anything and unlikely to use. I asked for a parking credit and again told no. If you are trying to call the operator/housekeeping or the concierge you will wait forever. No one answers the phone. On the one time I did get someone I inquired about take out/delivery options. The concierge was not able to give me any ideas...just said he could not help me.</td></tr>

There are over a dozen places to eat and free shuttles to the Disney Parks, including some cool water taxi's to a couple of the parks via the hotel's own waterways. The Boardwalk is short distance away by foot, and multiple pools are enhanced with a cabana bar, waterfall slides, and miniature "beach". This is a hotel for the visitor that wants to be out and about, though had I left the vicinity of Disney, it would be quite a bit of a drive. The room size was completely satisfactory, just a little bit less "fantastic" than I thought the hotel would contain based on the amenities they offer. Cleaniness was a little off here and there...for instance, the first day/night, my floor was sticky in the entryway (not sure if it was from cleaning product or just dirty) and there was a cup/mug ring on the dresser. Morning came and I wanted to make myself a coffee, opened the machine to start the heating, and the stagnant water it began to boil filled my room with the smell of mildew for a day and a half or more; no idea how long the water had been in there prior to my arrival. I had housekeeping remove it, but I never got a replacement. This is the only 'bad' customer service I received in the hotel. Service and staff were impeccably friendly and more than helpful, going out of their way to make sure I was accomodated, even if I didn't know I wanted to be! This is definitely a place perfect for those that want to be out of their room in the Parks until bed time and enjoy good eats.</td></tr>

Our daughters room had the entry light into room flickering and would not come on at all upon entry. Did have an awesome view and that helped us overlook some of the flaws. But then the second night we had this awful noise coming from above. Called to front desk and stated would check on it. An hour went by and the noise continued. (sounded like a tennis shoe in dryer) Called again and then finally they responded within 5 minutes. (had running toilet above us for hours) The third night of our stay our daughter came back from a wedding off the property and was unable to park in the self park area and was told to drive around until someone left. REALLY!!! They charge $22 for self parking each day! We did get some compensation after speaking with the manager but we will NEVER recommend or stay at this Belvoir even with the awesome view we had. Oh yes, they started ripping out the pool the 2nd day into our stay.</td></tr>

Unfortunately, its location is also a curse, as the electronic/dub step music from the rooftop bar permeates the pores of the hotel until 3 am, making it impossible to sleep. When we arrived (on Friday am), we discovered (as others have said) its next to impossible to secure a room upgrade (NB As a Platinum BPG member, this is the first time I have not been upgraded in 2 + years). The action in the bar also explains why the elevators are so slow (we waited for 10 minutes on two occasions on Saturday). Its because the hotel dedicates 2 of its elevators to the bar, including the service elevator, forcing its own staff to use the public lifts! Housekeeping was pretty iffy - we had to ask for everything! The staffing in the BPG lounge was spotty - they opened late & were inattentive when supplies ran out! The final straw came on Sunday, when after a night with zero sleep, there was no hot water to be had! We checked out early (a first!) and went to another hotel! (Mid-level management did not adequately respond to service concerns, another signal that all is not right @ the Belvoir Brooklyn).</td></tr>

I had a balcony that had a city view AND my bed faced the water - I had the best of both worlds! The hotel is right off of the highway and is river-front (I think it is the James River). The hotel literally sits in the midst of so much American History. You must walk the Board Walk and stop along the way to look at the bronzed letters (this will make sense once you get there). I loved the Owner's Club Lounge; had a nice variety and was open every time I needed a snack. The had drinks, fruit and yogurt available at all times; evening appetizers and a nice breakfast. The lounge overlooks the water, has plenty of seating, flat screen tv, computer AND printer. The gym is small but nice and clean with a temperature controlled "cooler" with small hand cloths. The outdoor pool was nice and it had lounge chairs which needed to be updated. I thought the pool areas was a little "dated". Check-in was a little longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. The staff is extremely accommodating and actually came from behind the desk and handed me my room keys (I cannot remember his name, but it had a very unique spelling). I opted to self-park in the garage ($8.00 with the Belvoir discount); the last time I stayed, parking was free (of course it has been at least 1 year). Norfolk has rich history and has done a nice job in preserving it. aI highly recommend the Belvoir in Norfolk.</td></tr>

Our room had a sink that backed up so bad I can not believe that a house keeper cleaning the sink would not have seen this. In addition our toilet backed up and we had to have maintenance work on the toilet 3 different times. I don't believe this is reflective of the majority of Shearton properties I have stayed at over the years but of a reflection of poor attention to detail and a definite lack of accountability. I believe your management needs to pay attention to visible details and hold staffs accountable. In addition I found the dining room menue to be very poor in terms of options. As a result we only had one meal on property in five days. Lastly each morning the maids meet at there supply room to gather their things for the day. However the amount of noise and commotion taking place in this room and in the immediate hallway needs to be stopped. At times it was like a mini convention holding a political rally, noisy and conjusted. I suggest more time be spent cleaning hall ways, doors and walls with finger prints on them and picking up room service dishes that are left in the hallways for a day or more. Bottom line I was very disappointed in our stay at your property.</td></tr>

The rooms were very well kept and clean. We liked having lots of pillows, the complimentary water was a fabulous unexpected amenity and the staff was very helpful. Our first night we realized we had a leak in the bathroom causing a small puddle. We are pretty easy so we just called the front desk to alert them and said it was fine to us as long as it didn't get worse but just wanted them to know. They sent maintenance right away. He brought us extra towels for the floor and told us he would have it fixed first thing in the morning, which he did. The front desk was always pleasant as were the valets and porters. My son ended up with a collection of stuffed animals from Disneyland and the housekeepers would always arrange them nicely on his bed for him. He enjoyed that. Overall, it was a great hotel and experience. We chose to walk to Disneyland every day which was about 10-15 minutes depending on crowd and crosswalk lights. We could also walk to Garden Walk for dinner. We never used the ART but the hotel hasa nice sitting area for it to stop at right out front. The laundry room was great to have, although, it took us almost 3 hours to do a load because we had to run the dryer twice to get clothes fully dry. That was a bummer to have to sit there that long with nothing to do. Finally, the snack shop was a great option although pricey. We wish Molly's Kitchen was open for dinner because Overland seemed very dead and the food wasn't that great. We would definitely stay here again.</td></tr>

Had it not been for another guest in her party, my eighteen year old daughter would have been left without a room in a unfamiliar city despite the fact she had a confirmed reservation in her name with her credit card. She has been to Europe and back, yet she was not permitted to check into this upscale, personal-service minded hotel. She was there for a wedding party and this debacle made it memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. Sure wish the staff had reacted to my daughter as they did to some the other people who left reviews here.

Also, there is no affordable coffee and quick food available early morning (6 a.m.) range.</td></tr>

The bathroom was very small and very much like a motel bathroom. It was a Garden Room on the 4th floor. The big problem was the A/C unit, which sounded like a jet engine. We complained on night #1, they said they would have engineering look at it. Problem was not fixed. We complained again. The front desk informed us that this was a "new" A/C unit and are much louder. So, they knew about this problem but yet did not move us when we originally complained. This front desk clerk, immediately changed our room to one with a quieter A/C unit and credited our resort fee for our entire stay. That was much appreciated.</td></tr>

I asked to speak to the manager and explained this was not mentioned when I reserved the room. Also when we checked in we used one card but I didn't want that card used so I switched cards. I had to wait over 40 minutes for the staff to figure it out. They keep complaining I wasn't being charged enough. Well I looked at my statement and I was charged more than if I hadn't cancelled my last night. I was originally staying for 4 nights and stayed only 3, but I was charged for 4 and after my stay I see a small charge from them! What is that from?

The Staff was great while we were at the hotel! Everything was Great! When I got home and looked at my receipt I discovered a Resort Fee which I was not made aware of along with a Parking fee again which I was not made aware of. Being in the hospitality business I find these fees as a "money grab" and am highly put off by extra fees. If you want to raise your rates do so, but don't keep adding unknown fees. What did I get for the Resort Fee? NOTHING that I know of. Valet Parking - yes my car was parked and I got two bottles of ice cold water when we checked out. Neither of which I think is worth $15 when the parking lot was within steps of the front door. Had I known this I would have parked my car myself. I loved the hotel and the renovation is superb, but I may have to think twice about staying myself and putting my groups at the hotel. I am a tour operator and was looking for some new hotels in the Orlando area. I had met one of your sales people in Jacksonville the week before and thought I'd try out the hotel on her recommendations. It is easy to add extra charges when customers pay with a credit card and then they are in a hurry in the morning and don't take the time to look at the bill at the time.</td></tr>

It needs more staff to handle the morning surge of guests. Also, it needs a better screening system, to keep out people who walk through the door with legitimate club lounge guests. No newspapers in this lounge too!</td></tr>

Because I have been a Platinum member for quite some time, and a rather frequent visitor to this hotel, I am always upgraded to a lovely suite. This time, however, not only did I not get a suite (which would have been OK on it's own), I was placed in a wheelchair accessible room, which was very awkward, (which also would have been OK, had I been advised as to why and beforehand at the front desk) and a first floor room- when I specifically ask for a higher floor room in my profile. I went back to the front desk to request an upgrade but was quickly told that none were available. It was as if I was lucky to get any room at all (even though I made the reservation over a month prior), but was offered no explanation. Access to the very nice Club Lounge was included. However, my one glass of wine was not. The computer in the lounge was down and after standing and waiting to be charged, the attendant finally gave up and said he would call me later to verify the exact amount, which he did. Good grief- a free glass of wine for the sub par room and inconvenience would have been nice, but it was not to be. I will return, as I'm almost positive that this was just a one off experience.</td></tr>

Its Grandbourne Preferred Guest Level has beautifully furnished King Executive Suites with two television sets, microwave, rerigerator, a large walk-in closet, sofa, large desk robe, slippers, a vanity area, and so much more. Its BPG Lounge with Rick and Angelo provides the finest possible service and outstanding wines and cheese, crackers, nuts, friuits, and so much more. The Guest Services Staff anticipates one's needs from having a copy of the Buffalo News reserved for you, to simply taking the time to listen to the guest no matter how busy the hotel is. Thanks to Kate, Melissa, Diane, Eamon, and the entire team. The Jade Room at Breakfast has very nice food,but servers like Laura, Wendi, Alanna, and Michelle anticipate my needs and are ready to serve me at 6 a.m. TGI Friday's also features many wonderful servers like Debbie, Jennifer, Amy, and great managers like Dan and Sue. Geoffrey and Monica are Sales/Marketing leaders of excellence that have done so much to enhance my stays. Stephanie, Natalie, and Pamela support the managers very well and are always available to help the guests. Belvoir At The Falls is a most special hotel with a staff and management that does everything in its power for one to have a memorable stay. Please come to Belvoir At The Falls and see how much a hotel staff can care and exceed one's expectations. It is my opinion that one will not find a more dedicated staff, even in the Housekeeping and Engineering areas, than this one. It truly is a joy to stay at Belvoir At The Falls!</td></tr>

I think a small portion of the dining area could be open for dinner if a guest preferred it. As always the Belvoir beds, bedding, and pillows were super comfy.

The room was adorable, as was the whole hotel. After being away all day we came back to our room to find that it had been cleaned, but we had no towels. We had to call the front desk twice to get all the towels and washcloths we needed. We went to the Main Street restaurant expecting some kind of Southern Comfort menu, since that was advertised in their elevators. We were not expecting to find the crazy, loud bar or a 30-minute wait for an appetizer (that wasn't very good). The food overall was a disappointment. The next morning we went to the club level to eat the breakfast for Gold Members (which is routine at all Belvoir's and the front desk had specifically told us was going to happen) only to find the room empty and no food in sight. When we asked about it, all we were told was that we were not the first to complain about it that day. We had to get home, so we couldn't stick around to find out if breakfast ever happened that day.</td></tr>

If your in the other buildings it's as if you're an outcast with your own pool that has no food or beverage options. They also advertise the Rainforest Spa. The spa doesn't exist. I found this out after the front desk sent me looking for the "spa" in my building and after searching around I asked the Salon staff and found out the spa was actually in a hotel room - the one below my room. The pillows were flat and uncomfortable and the bathroom was extremely dim. The shower also had no water pressure (an issue I heard among many guests). We also were put in a room that had no towels and were told it would be a few hours to get them (another issue shared among guests) In the rooms we had no cell service and terrible wifi. Most of the time you loose connection. As far as food - in the book of guest services it states that breakfast is from 7:30-10:30am (pretty early considering the times of all other hotels) - found out the hard way that they changed their hours to 7:30am-9:30am - even worse and we missed breakfast. When we finally made it to Rum Fire for breakfast the next day it was a good 15 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink...another 15 minutes before we got our coffee and juice. And, much later before we got our food. Needless to say, we did not go there for dinner due to terrible service. Luckily, we found The Shops at Kukui ula and stumbled upon amazing food places for a quarter of the prices at the Belvoir. The location of the actual main pool on the beach was beautiful. Due to the lack of amenities (spa, room service -which doesn't serve breakfast fyi) I would not stay there again. We were on our honeymoon and expected to relax in a spa, not have to rush out for breakfast and were very disappointed.</td></tr>

The fitted sheet was half off the bed and the pillows were all ove r the floor and chair.That was phone call #1 to guest servics. Phone call #2 came after realizing that the sink was clogged. There is no way housekeeping could have cleaned it and left it that way. Very disappointed. I also noticed that there was visible dirt on the floor and it did not appear to have been vacuumed. I didn't even bother to call about the floor . It was late and I wanted to get dinner and go to bed. I just made sure to kep my feet covered. The issues were addressed but Overall I was very surprised with all of these negatives. Questioning whether or not I would ever stay here again.</td></tr>

We are BPG gold members and owners at Maui but chose to pay cash for a 5 night stay at Belvoir Broadway Plantation in Myrtle Beach. We booked an AARP nightly rate which included a $75 resort credit with a stay of four nights or more. At check in, we were given no paperwork...no confirmation of nightly rate, no mention of the resort credit and were required to get our parking pass from vacation services (aka timeshare sales appointments) before our room keys would be issued. We returned to the front desk after unloading our luggage (about an hour later )to confirm our nightly rate and inquire about the resort credit. We were informed there are no resort amenties toward which a resort credit could be used and offered a $50 gift card to a local restaurant. I opted to call BPG customer serice and was eventually contacted by the front desk manager who confirmed there were no resort amenities to use for a resort credit but again offered a $50 gift card to a local restaurant. Front desk manager finally agreed to provide us with a $75 gift card (we think to get rid of us) but did not seem particularly concerned that nightly rates, including a resort credit, continue to be posted on BPG.com.</td></tr>

I had to call the front desk on two occasions, once at 12:30am. They should be aware of the volume of the lobby music - especially at that time of the night. The other nights I just dealt with it - I only called the nights where the noise kept me awake. Other than that, everything was fine. I choose Belvoir so I can count on a good night's sleep.

Just out of the shower and not fully dressed. Check out time is at 12:00 noon and I dont think housekeeping should be knocking on doors and intruding on guests before then. Prior to this we could hear them knocking on other guests doors and talking loudly in the hall, as we were trying to sleep. We finally decided that sleeping in was not an option. We were on the 6th floor, club level and you think they would have been more courteous. We felt like the whole floor was being kicked out as they were knocking on all the doors and opening them, hours before check out. Other than that, our stay was great and the room was very cozy.

There was an A/C problem, but the staff fixed it in no time. We stayed for two nights. Friday night, the Swan and Dolphin had their own Food and Wine event with live music and lots of good food and wine. We had to navigate through to get to the boardwalk, but it looked like fun had we not had our 5-month old with us. On Sat, took the ferry to Epcot, spent 6 great hours eating and drinking through the park, and took the ferry back. Super convenient. Ate a snack on site and breakfast on Sunday. The prices were high, but to be expected. I must give the hotel credit for allowing Grandbourne members to waive the resort fee in lieu of bonus points, and providing free wifi. I always hated those extra expenses. Booked the room with points too, so only expenses at the hotel were parking and dining. Didn't get to use the pool or fitness center, but they looked amazing. Not waiting three more years to come back! We all had a great time and I forgot what a nice property it was.</td></tr>

The dinner there the night before was truly excellent, and the service was as well. The whole hotel facility was very attractive and well-maintained.

We asked the manager twice if he could turn down the awful music and he said he would 'see what he could do.' Huh? The music stayed the same volume throughout. The service was very very slow (15 minutes to get our drinks, 30 minutes to get our first course) even though the place was not nearly full. I think our waitress, kind but unschooled, might have been serving the whole room. The manager mostly chatted up the customers, without actually doing something constructive and helpful.</td></tr>

Alas, it is, and the price is still high. Very, very, very unfair. What is the point of paying so much for room, and having to pay high parking and internet fees in addition?

What I found very upsetting was I was promised a comp for my long wait one day, a very nice offer, but when I returned home to see my bill, I found it was only lip service as I was charged.

The Room Service agent explained to me that the menu's in the room are out-dated and that the hotel no longer serves those items.

I was assured after complaining the third time that they were bumping up the temp but it would take a while. Went out to dinner and when we gave it another try it did seem a little better. My son even went in. However, in the morning, I thought it would be even warmer, and it was just as cold as when we first arrived. Got in and got out immediately. Been staying here for a few years now and the pool used to be so warm. I don't know what happened. I had a problem last time also, but figured I would give it another try. I will definitely be finding another hotel on Long Island with a warmer pool in the future.</td></tr>

Each stay my impression of this hotel continues to decline. Upon my most recent trip the hotel continues to battle a sewage smell that permeates the property, even to my floor on the 10th floor. Elite status is often overlooked by all staff and you have to ask repeatedly for your amenities, like free wifi. When dealing with the front desk you would think the lines for all BPG properties ring there and the staff at the front desk prioritizes phone calls over dealing with guests. On top of this, my most recent trip to the property was on business and there was a reduced room rate. However, I was traveling with colleagues and knew we would be working on some projects and requested a larger room via the phone a few days prior. They said I would have a larger room on the club level. When I arrived the room was no different than those I was traveling with and yet I was paying an extra $90/night for the Club Level. When I inquired at the front desk (after waiting for the phone calls to end) I was told they would check with the manager and contact me. Never heard a word from them. I believe in the BPG brand but when I travel to Des Moines for business in the future I will seek a different property.</td></tr>

Derick at the front desk has never had a issue that he couldn't resolve. Mary in the club lounge is thoughtful and caring (I didn't make it breakfast one day because I was not feeling weland she sent ginger ale with a coworker for me).

We never had any more trouble with it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, Downtown Disney, and Disneyland. Breakfast was not provided, so we just went to the shop on the first floor and got a muffin or breakfast sandwich. It was a little expensive, but the food was good.

What a pleasant surprise - upon entering the hotel, it was very clean and the checkin time took less than 5 minutes.

Found the place a bit difficult to get around in as the many paths that lead to room/front desk are somewhat confusing between all the walkways and doors. However the front desk personnel were very disappointing in their attitude from the beginning of our stay to the end - three of our party there for a family event had trouble getting the group room rate and then to add injury to insult had to wait a hour after 3 p.m. check-in time to get the room thus giving them 45 minutes to get ready to go to event at 5 p.m. When approached about wifi problem in room and not getting access on computers in lobby merely shrugged it off by saying "it happens sometimes". One of the front desk staff was extremely rude in his tone vocally and with facial expressions from eye rolling to sneering when asked about room preparation for check-in and about way to get to a room in the C building because he had to repeat both answers. One of the most important qualities of a hotel is front desk which give the first impression to guests upon arrival and sadly to say the physical hotel can be beautiful and perfect but the personnel behind the desk is what makes a guest comfortable and eager to return when in the area again. Your hotel failed this test and I would not repeat a visit nor recommend your place to anyone traveling to the area.</td></tr>

Woke up around 12 am freezing still. Called the front desk with no answer. Woke up every hour I would say cold and uncomfortable. Called the front desk again around 830 just ready to get out of here with no shower obviously I know this room was around 50 degrees. Was offered $25 refunded or free breakfast. I asked for the corporate number and called them . I've yet to hear from them three days later . The hotel called back and offered $25 more back. I was still I satisfied and he took off another $25 and says he sent me an email for a future stay which I have not received. So in the end I paid $80 for a room with no heat still not happy. If anyone knew at checking they were paying even $80 for a room with no heat they wouldn't checkin. Very unhappy with the customer service.</td></tr>

Out of about 80 guests, only a handful had no issues at check-in. The staff overbooked the hotel, on a weekend with a class reunion, a convention, and 4 weddings. They tried to put the bride's 85 year old grandmother on a cot. They disregarded my request for rooms next to eachother let alone an adjoining door as I had 2 two year olds and my mom (babysitter). After my sister checked in, the cleaning lady came to the room and said that they had checked out. The bride arrived to check into her bridal suite and the staff had the gull to tell her they didnt have a room for her. She waited an hour in the lobby with her hair and makeup done and dress in-tow. Check-out was no different. They didn't have any dollies available. I asked a doorman if I could use the one he was unloading afterwards, and he accepted. When he finished he went back on his word and went upstairs with it, no doubt in order to receive a tip from someone. So our check-out took an extra hour since we had 3 suitcases, 2 bathroom bags, toy bags, diaper bag, 2 pack n plays (cause they didnt give us the cribs we reserved, thank heaven we packed those), and several items. You might as well not make a reservation because whatever you reserve, you wont get it. Oh yah, also not a good place to go for quietness. ALthough they have signs posted for quiet hours they dont enforce it. The reunion party took to more floors then they were welcomed. Doors slamming, thumping music etc, nobody on floor 15 slept that night.</td></tr>

Specifically, it was very inconvenient that we could not get an update on when our room would be ready over the phone. Instead, I was told I had to inquire in-person. As someone traveling from another state, this was very inconvenient. Our room had a large wet spot on the floor and a distinct odor. When we reported it, we were helped by an extremely nice maintenance man and I give him high remarks. The other major disappointment with this stay was that my debit card was charged for the incidentals fee after I was told only my credit card would be charged. At this point, I have left two messages for someone at the hotel and have yet to have my call returned. This is an issue with my bank account and I find it extremely rude that my call has not been returned nor has the charge been reversed on my card. This is enough to deter me from staying at any Belvoir in the future.</td></tr>

I attended our club's gala event, and since i had waited in line for 20 minutes at the cash bar, I ended up at the end of the food line. imagine my surprise when most of the food was GONE!

The restaurant was so dirty and each time the waiter tried giving me a new cup of coffee there was always something floating in the cup.

The ottoman was in the entryway and I almost broke my neck tripping over it (the chair it goes to was on the other side of the room. No reason for it be where it was except pure laziness). Once I got into the room I turned the air down (that had to be the most complicated thermostat I have ever used.) I went to the bathroom to take a shower since we had been at the fair all day. I walk in to find no shampoo, no soap, and the worst thing was a half USED bottle of mouthwash. I called downstairs to get some toiletries sent up. It took calling 4 times and listening to the ring for 15 min. before someone finally answered in a rude tone. I requested the items and she said she would have house keeping bring them up. Almost 2 hours later I finally hear a knock on the door. When voicing my complaints to the service desk upon checkout I was comped parking. Sure glad they saved me that few bucks.</td></tr>

The bathroom over flowed in our room as well as our friends room. Maintenance was at our rooms more than we were. But the topper was that staff miss handled our billing and over charged us.

The curtains had a liner that blocked the light out well, which is ok if you prefer a dark cave rather than being able to see out. I like the gradual lightening in the morning as the sun rises. Third, the main elevator's doors didn't close until having been open for several minutes. There is another set of elevators not far from the first one. One of the staff told me it was to be replaced and signs had been posted pointing to the second set. Perhaps they would do better to advise guests not to use that elevator.</td></tr>

There was no ice machine on my floor OR the one below me. The carpet in our room was ratty looking. The beds were very uncomfortable. For over $200 a night, I expected a LOT more. I've stayed at lower tier hotels from competitors that were nicer than this full Belvoir.</td></tr>

The food was abysmal and overpriced. I ate at the one restaurant (the website said there were 2-3 restaurants available) and the food portion sizes were minuscule. A cup of gumbo and a side salad racked up a $42 lunch bill. Are you freaking kidding me? I could have walked acoss the street and had a 4- course meal for that price. Leaving the hotel for the airport, the valets put me in a sketchy cab that tried to rip off myself an another passenger and the valets put another person's bag in my cab so we had to drive 15 minutes back to the hotel in order to drop off the bag. I almost missed my flight.</td></tr>

We have stayed there many times and on our most recent stay we were really pleased with how well we were accommodated by the front desk at check-in. Our room was by far the best we have stayed in at the property. I told the person checking us in that we were traveling with children and they gave a really nice big room. I love the club lounge at this hotel and the staff up there is really great. They always recognize us and give us great service. We had a small water leak in the room and the front desk sent a maintenance person up very quickly to address the problem and all was resolved. My only complaint after staying here many times over the years is that the lobby bar closes too early on Fridays and Saturdays and the lobby bar staff are not as welcoming as the staff in the club lounge. When we come to NYC with the kids we always stay here. Overall, this property is in perfect proximity to other bars, the subway, Broadway shows, times square and central park. BPG really treats their members well and that's why we bought into an ownership share. We will definitely be back to this Belvoir in December. Thanks for making it a great family trip to the big apple!</td></tr>

I went to the parking lot to retrieve my reservation from my car. Upon return, I waited in line (again) and was helped by the same employee. She carefully examined the printout for my hotel reservation and realized I was correct. She never apologized for the misunderstanding or even commented on her mistake. She checked me in, after giving her my identification and credit card again, and sent me on my way without even a thank you. This employee displayed a very poor attitude and unfortunately could not even offer basic customer service. Then after walking to the room, there were four dirty glasses outside our hotel room door.

We were very happy with the location...only a few blocks from Independence Mall. It is in a quieter area than some of the other conveniently located hotels, too, which we found pleasant. The gentleman who checked us in at the desk gets an A++ for professionalism, friendliness, and great service. We found the rest of the staff good too. Rooms looked very clean. I had wished there was a small fridge or microwave in the room for convenience, but the way things worked out the lack of these amenities wasn't much of an issue. I absolutely love that the property is 100% smoke free - getting stuck in a smoking room is a deal breaker for us and when all rooms are nonsmoking you don't have to worry about that happening. There was a wedding one night we were there and it was noisy...the walls seem not very soundproof and we could hear not only the wedding music into the night but clearly heard conversations of the people in the next room, but this was not enough of an issue that it would deter us staying again in the future. Overall, very happy with our choice to stay here. All properties near the historic district are expensive but this wasn't any worse than others in the area with the special they were offering. If an affordable room was available on our next trip we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, I have forgotten his name, but to the gentleman working the check-in desk late at night on October 24th, thank you! Your customer service skills are outstanding and contributed much to our high level of satisfaction.</td></tr>

Fortunately, an astute member of the staff suggested a room change after multiple complaints about the telephone (see below) and the guests were transferred, including the refrigerator.

I expressed that we were in a hurry, and asked if there was a faster way. She said "no" and that I would have to wait until all of the people in front of me were helped first. There was a significant line of people. The problem with that is the fact that I was the second person to walk into the business center to inquire. While she was looking for my package in the computer, several others had walked in. Again, she was truly rude.

Megan than pulled the reciept and asked for something with my signature on it which I provided my driver's license, and two other items with my signature. It was quite obvisous it was not my signature however she spent at least 3 to 5 minutes doing a handwriting analyasis at which time I told just charge me for the $17 as she is was questioning my interigity. She than hestatily stated she would remove the charge. The second issue was with the valet parking. I was charged for two cars and and only had one. She questioned this too. The impression I got from her was she was not there to help but question everything I brought up. After about 10 minutes they were able to get the bill right. The expierence at the hotel was an overall 4 out of 5 until check out. The check out process (which is the last impression a guest recieves) had convinced me to book another hotel the next time I am in the area.</td></tr>

We loved the facility and the shower room was very clean and included all the toiletries, even mouthwash. I felt very spa pampered. We then decided to eat lunch at the burrito/hot food bar. I got the pot roast. It was seriously the best pot roast i ever had. It was definitely a 5 star experience from the time we were greeted at the front desk until we drove away.

Although we were at the resort to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary, life back home still had to be handled. It was shortly after we arrived in our room that we discovered that the internet was not working. We called down and was told to contact the IT department. We did this 3 times in the course of 2 days trying to get coverage. A modem was finally bought to the room which improved things a bit. Later this same evening It was time for our celebratory dinner and while getting ready, I was greeted by a cockroach from behind the bathroom mirror. We immediately contacted the front desk and was told they would spray while we were at dinner. Upon our return to the room it was evident that the room had been sprayed even though we were told the spray would be odorless. With all that being said, the location of this property cannot be beat, its beautiful. I just wish my lasting impressions of the property were better.</td></tr>

I've stayed twice in the last 5 years and both times was disgusted by the condition of the room. Battled ants in [YEAR-4] and last week - what appeared to be tiny roaches? Mattresses are old, carpet is stained and filthy. The bathroom walls have not been wiped down in DECADES. And the grout in the tub/shower area is nearly black with grime. The room smells old and musty. I thought my experience in [YEAR-4] was a fluke - I now know this is just the condition of this sub-standard facility. It's really a shame because the beach location is wonderful. One shouldn't have to feel like they need a shower after stepping out of the hotel shower. I would be embarrassed to recommend this location to anyone (without a huge warning/disclaimer about the rooms). For this reason, I won't return until they renovate. Too many other options available in that price range.</td></tr>

Due to the rippleing in 1 of the rooms. But. All and all a fine stay, and the grand kids had a great time.</td></tr>

However I was quite shocked at the daily resort fee for "internet access, 2 bottles of water and access to gym" Also the fee just to park my car ($15 for self park or $20 for valet plus tax). In addition when I reviewed my bill there was a charge for the lobby lounge after I went to bed. I went to dispute my bill along with other issues and my interigity was questioned by front desk staff "Megan" I explained I did not have these drinks in fact when I checked I specificly requested I did not want any room charging priviledges to my room. Megan than pulled the reciept and asked for something with my signature on it which I provided my driver's license, and two other items with my signature. It was quite obvisous it was not my signature however she spent at least 3 to 5 minutes doing a handwriting analyasis at which time I told just charge me for the $17 as she is was questioning my interigity. She than hestatily stated she would remove the charge. The second issue was with the valet parking. I was charged for two cars and and only had one. She questioned this too. The impression I got from her was she was not there to help but question everything I brought up. After about 10 minutes they were able to get the bill right. The expierence at the hotel was an overall 4 out of 5 until check out. The check out process (which is the last impression a guest recieves) had convinced me to book another hotel the next time I am in the area.</td></tr>

My co-worker went to the restaurant and they were out of everything he requested for breakfast. Then the next day he sat for 15 minutes and didn't get waited on and left. Then I went to get a drink and they were out of sangria. Then I pre-ordered room service to deliver between 7:45-8am the next morning. At 8:05am I called and they said they were sorry they forgot it. I said change it to a bagel because it is easier to make and I knew I would have time to eat it. They said another 10 minutes. 25 minutes later my order still was not there. I told them I was leaving my room in 5 more minutes. They said it would be up there. I waited another 10 minutes and my cold bagel finally arrived. He said "this time since it was 3 tries of getting it right he could give it to me for free" and I said "after wait over an hour it should be free". I felt like every time I called he acted like I was overreacting. I used to work in room service many years ago and i know the pre-ordered stuff is the top priority so to tell me that after making a mistake it would only be 10 minutes and then add another 25 and then another 10 on top of that was unacceptable. I know there are mistakes but me having to call back a third time is not acceptable.</td></tr>

I was counting on a stress free stay since we had so much stress from the wedding already. From the moment of check-in, however, our stay was anything but stress-free. There was only one cart available when we unloaded so we had to wait a few minutes for one to be available to us. Then at the desk, we were less than an hour before rehearsal and they would not let me check in because the reservation was under my husband's name, even though I called twice before to confirm that there would be no issue. The gentleman at the front desk offered no options or help of any kind, which made me even more upset. Finally we were able to get up to our room and when we did, there was a soaking wet towel in the bathtub. Housekeeping did come up to take care of it right away. The elevators were incredibly slow. We waited at least 5 minutes each time, even though there are 3 elevators. Then on check out, there was a waiting list for luggage carts so we ended up taking our belongings, including my wedding dress and steamer, down in a few loads to the car. Positives: the food from room service wasn't bad and the bed was comfortable. There was no mini-fridge, which was disappointing, and the room we stayed in was pretty worn. On our previous stay, the room was much nicer. I would recommend the hotel for one reason, the location. You can't beat it but I wouldn't pay for this hotel if it wasn't where it is.</td></tr>

There is never enough staff and those who are there seem very irritated and frustrated. It comes across very negatively and as extremely poor customer service. Even the manager didn't seem to know how to handle situations. Several of us had to come back to the desk, because the rooms we were given were not what we reserved or agreed to receive. This has happened to me for the past 3 years in a row. The manager tried to joke and rush to action before even comprehending my concern. Finally, however, he did get it right, but it took over 30 minutes. Next, valet completely bent my license plate. After calling it to their attention, they tried to say that it was not them. However, the plate was not bent when I first left my vehicle with valet services. They attempted to straighten it back out, but it is still slightly bent. Breakfast this year was very subpar what I'm used to having at the Belvoir. So much so, that I refused to do dinner there as my family and I usually do.

I had to call the next morning at 630am only to be told they did not have my bag. Except when I asked them to double check, and oh, they did have it! Also, my roomate and I asked specificially that I pay for the first three nights and she pay for the last night...they split the room rate for each night between us anyway and we had to have this corrected off of our credit cards. On Saturday they did not come to clean our room, and by 4pm we called to request that they please come...finally an hour later they came to clean. On a positive note, the room service people were friendly and efficient and the food was great both in the room and at the restaurant. Another nice thing was the comfy beds.</td></tr>

Lisa, Elizabeth, and the team at the front desk treated us like gold. Our room and our bed was clean and comfortable. The pool was amazing and the bar was too. The team that took care of us while we enjoyed food and drinks by the pool was EXCELLENT!! Jason, Enrique, Ivanna, Mariana, and Samuel were all willing to go above and beyond every time they helped us. We made it a point to enjoy the pool before and after we went to Disney each day. Breakfast each day was fantastic. We were lucky to enjoy that each morning. Saving the BEST for last, My wife and I had the sincere PLEASURE of having BRENDA take care of us every morning at breakfast. She is a true example of what customer care is all about. She became a friend by the end of our stay and we truly look forward to seeing her again on our next visit. We have stayed many times in the Disney Hotels on their property. Their service and facilities paled in comparison to what we experienced during our 10 Days at the Belvoir Buena Vista. We visit Disney once or twice a year and will stay here from now on. We HIGHLY recommend this property and the team that keeps it as spectacular as it was for us.</td></tr>

Later we came to find out from the receptionist from the bay tower that there was a shuttle that could of brought us back.</td></tr>
