I found this hotel in need of renovation. The carpet in my room was stained and needed replacement. There were constantly kids running up and down the hallway on the 3rd floor and the room was recommended to be quiet when we checked in. In the adjoining room there was constant barking from a dog! I don't know why Belvoir would allow dogs on the 3rd floor, or why someone would take their pet to Disneyland? I will not be staying at this property again!

About a week prior to that we decided to come down a day early. I called your hotel to book a room for th 26th as well. I was told that your hotel was booked. I then went on Hotwire and booked a hotel room for that night instead. Once I confirmed the reservation I was told by Hotwire that it was your hotel that I was being booked at. This was of course after I was told by your staff that the hotel was book. The first room we were given for the 26th was a nightmare. There were people hanging out in the hallway until 10:30 at night. When that noise finally died down the room next to us exploded with children screaming and running around the room until 1:00 in the morning. I have never stayed in a hotel that was that loud. It sounded like these people were in the same room as we were. I had my two small children with me and none us go to sleep until after 1:00 a.m. When I checked out of that room in the morning and into our original reservation I told the front desk how disatisfied I was with our room and the experience thus far with your hotel. All I received was a ""Sorry"". Our next room was nice and much more quiet. However, when we booked that reservation we booked it to include breakfast in the morning. The breakfast was a joke. Unless you got there at 6:00 a.m. there was no food left. We ended up eating in the restaurant the next day and waited 45 minutes for an omlette.

I thought the room rate for this hotel was overpriced and I consider it to be a 3 star hotel. I was there for an event 0n the evening of July 28, 2012 for which the group rate was outrageously high for one night, I feel I was robbed. The group rate especially for the event and the organization that gave the event at this hotel was very excessive due to the fact that most of the people there were from the tri-state area and not tourist. The rate should have been no much less per night, the organization which I dont want to name can clearly pack this entire hotel if the rates were better, Im coming to an event here in December but if the rates arent cheaper Ill stay at home which is only 15 minutes off the expressway. I have stayed with this organization at other hotels in New Jersey and Wilmington Delaware and paid much less per night for the same type of and/or holiday event. One thing I would like to say also during the time of the even there was lady with a radio who looked to be in charge and a young man also with a radio. These two persons were working their butts off. Everywhere they were needed, anything that they were able to help they were there and they looked to make sure everything was running as smooth as possible. I give both of these people BIG TIME PROPS, they were very nice and friendly even if under pressure you couldnt tell because they always had a smile on their faces. I wish I knew their names (Caucasian stocky woman and thin African American young man) to put in this feedback but Im sure you know who they are. My room was the downer for me. My room looked as if someone was sleeping in my bed before I got there. I actually thought I was mistakenly placed in an occupied room. It was very un-appealing and un-inviting. The towels in the bathroom were folded but thrown on the towel racks and I had only one wash cloth and I didn't even have one of those small boxed shower caps. I was very disappointed with this. I know Belvoir to have great hotels but this one has not changed very much over the past 10 years. It was actually better when it was the under another name.

On Monday morning, I received a bill under the door. At the pool, I ordered a fruit plate. The fruit (some of it) didn't smell/taste fresh. The dining room seating (outside) was not clean. Where my daughter and I sat, hair was all over the couch. Some of the towels were overly worn. There was dust/dirt on the base boards in the room.

Another maintenance man came up and we were told that we should call the front desk so we could move rooms. So I did....now this is 2;30 in the morning not very convenient at all to be dragging our luggage down to another floor and once again get all the beds set up. We had to use a pull out to accomodate us. The room was stuffy when we got in there and it took a good 30 mins for it to cool off.

The king executive suite on the BPG floor exceeded my expectations for both cleanliness and amenities. The carpet was freshly shampooed upon my arrival, and later on that evening, a beautiful welcoming amenity was delivered to the room. Both TGI Friday's and the Jade Room for breakfast the next morning provided me with outstanding cuisine and service. The BPG Club Level had a most wonderful evening reception with many wonderful wine and food selections. No other hotel anywhere has ever provided me with a more personalized level of service from Guest Services to Food and Beverage. The Housekeeping was exceptional in that the room was equipped with every amenity one could want and more.

We were very happy with the staff at the hotel. They were very pleasant, knowledgeable and responsive to our needs. For example, the iron in our room was not functioning. A call to the front desk and I had a new iron brought to the room within 15 minutes, very impressive! The room was very clean and in good condition, newly renovated I believe, although a little small, but this is expected in NYC hotels. My only complaint about the room was that the closet was a bit difficult to manage, it is not designed to allow for many hanging clothes. Also there were no drawers in which to store clothes. The closet had just a small table with 2 shelves in it. It would even have been better if it had drawer fronts on it. It was fine for a short stay but for an extended stay the lack of drawers would be very frustrating. The full length mirror is awkwardly place in the closet which my wife found frustrating. The room had a 42 inch T.V. which was nice. The area around the hotel is generally safe, during the day I had no concerns, but I would be a bit more alert if walking late at night on Fulton Mall in the immediate area of the hotel. The hotel has good interior security and requires a room key to access the elevators. There are 3 nearby subway stations and allowed easy access to multiple lines. The only downside of this location is the difficulty in getting Taxi's. We got lucky that a taxi had been coming down Duffield street as we were leaving the Hotel, but getting one is hit or miss. It is not like getting a Taxi in Manhattan. So if you are late for something and need a taxi expect to either walk a few blocks or hope someone is being dropped off at the hotel. There is a roof top club at the Hotel that is just above the club floor. I appreciated that the staff accommodated our request to be moved down to a lower floor (22 rather than 25) I was willing to trade the club level for the assurance of a good nights sleep on the preferred guest floor. It was very quiet and we were never disturbed by the music. There are many nearby restaurants in the area as you head west towards the Heights."

Not at this hotel!,"When I arrived at the hotel I was told the hotel was ""full"" and finding a room with my bed preference would be difficult. I had a reservation in advance and was surprised at this given I was an BPG member. When I got to my room in the ""older"" wing of the hotel, I noticed a person was sitting on the room patio. It was a cook with the hotel, and his entire grill/cooking set-up with chaffing dishes, outside my patio door. There was a party about to take place directly outside my door. As a business traveler with an early meeting, I immediately requested a room change. It took approx 20 minutes before a new key arrived for my next room. When I got to the next room, the AC was broken. While the room was quiet, and hot, it was also dirty. There were stains on the carpet and the fabric of the shower curtain. There was hair on the bathroom floor and what appeared to be a blood stain in the drain area of the tub. At this point it was getting late, I was on my second room, and I was ready to eat dinner. The person I was traveling with, also an BPG Gold Member, checked in with similar room problems. We both decided to stick it out for night and grab some dinner before it was too late. When we left for dinner, we discovered that when they transferred our rooms, they did not move our parking validation to the new room key. So we could not exit the parking structure. We rang for assistance and were first interrogated over the speaker phone by the attended. When he realized we could not get out of the parking structure with our current keys he came out to meet us. He was rude in responses to us and told us to ""take it up"" with the front desk people to fix our key. When we returned from dinner, we stopped at the front desk and told them what happened in the parking garage and advised about the rude employee. They said they would fix it and re-keyed us. In the morning when we went to check out, they tried to charge us twice for parking! After explaining what happened the night before the front desk person actually asked me how my stay was.. I told them dissapointing. Not once did she ask if there was something that could be improved or even tried to get any further information. She just handed me my receipt. The entire stay with the hotel was a dissapointment. I recently joined BPG membership and aquired an BPG AMEX credit card. I am a member of a competing preferred guest program. This experiece does not even come close to the same quality as similiar programs."

When I can, I try to stay in BPG hotels because of the wonderful costomer service, and because I know I will be staying in a nice, clean, safe environment. This stay started off by waiting an hour and a half at the airport for the shuttle bus. When it picked me up at almost midnight, it was so full of other people who had been waiting just as long, that I was the last person it could hold. The driver had to turn away approximately forty other people, a lot of them families with children, to pick up later. This was just unacceptable. Then there was only one person working the reception desk, which slowed check in down to a crawl. I landed at ten p.m. and it was around two thirty a.m. when I finally got to my room, which wasn't all that great. The next day when I attempted to check out, the reception desk was understaffed again. I had to wait to check out because I never got my usual bill under my door and needed a hard copy for business reasons. After waiting behind a lady for almost half an hour, a group came in off a shuttle bus and someone came from the back to help them, but ignored me. Then, when the lady in fron of me was finally done, the girl behind the desk ignored me to wait on a girl who just walked in and rudely cut right in front of me. When she finally got to me and checked me out and I asked for a hard copy of my bill, she complained to me why didn't I just use the one from under my door? Really? I asked to speak to the manager, who of course was unavailable. BPG/Belvoir should take their name away from this hotel before it ruins their reputation."

I contacted the hotel the night before my arrival and they were able to secure a reservation for me and were happy to do so, so kudos to their front office. Check in was a breeze and I was put on the top floor, which is the club floor. The room was very large and was clean. AC was quiet, which some people can be concerned about. About the only item that could be an issue is that bathrooms are pretty small...the door actually opens up and brushes against the toilet. For me, I was not concerned with this, but it is worth noting. The club room was very nice and I wish I had more time to hang out there. I grabbed a couple of wings and a beer and went back to my room before heading out for the evening. Wings were good, beer was cold, worked for me. I didn't check out the pool or eat in the restaurant, but it all looked very nice. I definitely like the lobby and bar area and will check that out the next time i'm in town.

As I was checking-in to the hotel, I asked the clerk/reps for an easily accessible room -- that wouldnt require too much navigation for me to locate it. The front-desk reps were very responsive and facilitated my request. They were friendly and gave me additional information, verbally regarding the hotel layout and other important features on the premises. Also, a concierge provided particularly helpful and quick services; for example, she expeditiously got new washcloths for me, plus she patiently answered my other questions, and she carefully gave me verbal directions to some nearby points of interest ... enabling me to enjoy some of the local offerings there in Dallas. Several of the banquet staff also assisted me, as they informed me of all the beverages/nourishment available during the conference sessions. Some staff, in a few instances, kindly brought the selected hot tea and food back to my table. The friendly service was impressive to me. Good work deserves recognition. These staff well represent quality service, congruous with the Belvoir reputation. I was also personally assisted by a manager; when I was needing to get back to my room on the 4th floor, I asked a person near the elevator, who happened to be a manager, for assistance with the elevator, and he quickly helped me.

After our first stay I had a few small issues, which were virtually non existent during this stay because obviously the management listens and tries very hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We came from NJ with extended family from Washington State. We had two rooms on the same floor. Both of the rooms were comfortable, spacious, and clean. Pool was closed for one day when we went down, which was not the fault of the hotel but someone who allowed their small child to swim in it without a proper swim diaper. They had to thorougly clean and shock the pool for everyone's health safety. Lifeguard was great to have but really should keep a better eye on the pool. One guard had headphones in and was on her computer while parents were allowing their small children in the whirlpool, and others were throwing a ball back and forth between the pool and whirlpool. . During our last stay, the lifeguard was so good, she wouldn't allow my 13 year old in. The sign specifically says ages 16 and up. Not only is it a safety hazard for small children to use a hot tub, but it makes it less enjoyable for the adults to use.Only suggestion I have again is to remove the non gratis water from the rooms because this is the second time we got charged for water that we didn't drink. We brought water from home but I think if the maid sees empty water bottles in the recycling pail or garbage, you get charged. If water is available for sale in the vending machines on the floor, there really is no need to put it in the rooms."

The mattress itself was very wet and that wetness was seeping through the sheets and blankets. We called the front desk and were told to repack our belongings and come down to the front desk for another room assignment. The second room we were given was much smaller and without the amenities of the first room. I went back to the front desk and after much discussion they finally agreed to put us in a room that was the same quality as the first, but with two dry beds. We were told that a bellman would help us move our things since we'd had to move our things twice already. After waiting for 20 minutes we finally had to do it ourselves, as we had plans for the evening and couldn't wait any longer to get into our room. In all, check in took over an hour and a half. I was told that we'd be given 2000 star points to make up for the hassle, but those have not been credited to my account despite my calling several days ago to inquire. Also, in the room shuffle and the extra packing/unpacking we had to do we lost the top of an electric trimmer. I reported it missing Sunday at checkout and was told that I'd be called by Monday at the latest with information. By Wednesday I had still not been contacted so I had to follow up with the hotel.

The hotel was extremely full, due to teen sports teams playing the weekend we were there. The staff was very accomodating, which made our potentially disasterous vacation, bareable. Upon going to our rooms the halls were a mess, not due to lack of staff doing their job, but due to the lack of consideration of the team coaches and parental guidance. Once these issues were reported, it was fixed immediately. It is very unfortunate that we have to deal with this type of behavior when coming to a hotel that we expect to get top notch service from, especially when being an owner member. The staff did try their best to accommodate us to the best of their ability but we still feel a bit slated in that we didn't get the full feel of the family vacation that we expected to get. Hopefully next time this doesn't happen. I guess check and make sure there aren't any sports team events going on when you plan a vacation!!"

We were coming in from Las Vegas and I knew we were going to be late so I called ahead to make sure they knew we would be arriving late. We arrived around 2am and checked in at the Bay Tower. Juan at the front desk was very rude and told us that we would have to stay in the other tower (Marina Tower). We drove back over to the other tower and found our rooms after walking to the opposite side of the tower, outside and down some stairs. The rooms were filthy and extremely small. I would not have paid $50 to stay in these rooms called the 'Lanai Tower'. The doors were facing an open outdoor style hallway facing a dirty rundown parking lot with no type of security. Juan at the front desk did not even bother to give us any details about this room. We had 3 adults and 4 children and the rooms were too small to accommodate everyone as I specifically requested some roll away beds which were not available in this location. I tried to explain to the desk clerk that these were definitely not the rooms I reserved and they were unable to accommodate our needs. She did not seem to understand me and kept saying they had no availability and the rooms in the Bay Tower were EXACTLY the same. I do not understand how I could have a reservation and not be able to check in to the rooms I reserved. We ended up staying the night in these rooms and being moved the next day to the rooms I originally reserved. The rooms in the Bay Tower were much nicer, cleaner and larger so the fact that we kept being told they were the same is not true. I was upset over this entire experience and will not be staying here again. Also, if you are military or veteran, stay away! We paid for the rooms using military vouchers and I suspect that is why our rooms were downgraded!

Third, the balcony view was very nice but, again, for a suite, of which there are only eight of in the entire hotel, you would think the balcony would stand out from an average room, nope.

Staff is very friendly and helpful.,1,Satisfied customer,"My stay at the Belvoir was 8/19/12 through 8/24/12. The hotel entrance is on a very narrow one way street. Upon my arrival, there was a limo blocking part of the street where guests could park their car to check-in. Since I didnt think there was a place to park, I drove around the block and found a parking lot to park my car while I walked to the hotel to check-in and inquire about the parking. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Belvoir doesnt have any parking, but they recommended a lot one street over. You can have valet service parking which is $39 a day w/ in and out privileges or you can walk over and pick up car on your own for $25 a day which I chose to do. Now on your first day at the hotel, they will have someone drive your car to the lot without being charged the valet cost. However, you will have to pick your car up on day of departure if you dont want to pay $39 a day. Not a big deal since lot is a short walking distance, but it is in a sketchy area. The best thing to do is not have a car to park. There is plenty of public transportation. Buy an MTA card with unlimited usage, depending on your stay, and you can take the bus or subway all day long. I bought a 7-day card for $29 and never had to use my car. Anyway, back to the hotel. Its very nice. The room was very clean with white linens. Bed and pillows were very comfy. I had a room with two double beds. There was an armoire sized closet to hang clothes, but no drawers. There is a safe for money or jewelry. Easy to use with a swipe of a credit card instead of having to remember a code. There is a large desk and chair if you need to work. I didnt because I was on vacation, yay! There is a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee available. Water was provided for a charge. Not sure if coffee was free or not since Im not a coffee drinker. The 42 TV was nice, although the cable connection needs fixing. Short breaks in programs every now and then causing missed dialogue. Maybe wifi has something to do with it, which is free in the lobby. The view from my room was horrible. Looked at a construction site with large crane lovely. Didnt really bother me though because the location of the crane was actually helpful when trying to get my sense of direction outside the hotel. I could just look up and find the crane and know where hotel was. The hotel has a small pool, hot tub, and sunning area on the second floor. The second floor also has a work out area that can be accessed with your room key, which is really a card. (who uses keys anymore, right?) Also, youll need keycard to use elevator to go to your room. Pain in the pants, but good security measure. Another feature to your room, you can earn $5 coupon if you dont have maid service every day. Keepin it green gets you $5 off at their restaurant. Grubsteak is the hotel restaurant. Had breakfast there one morning with coupon in hand. No other customers were in the restaurant probably because it was like a freezer in there. The thermostat had to be set at 600, so much for going green. Brrrrr. I like it cold, but that was too cold. I think it probably drove a few customers away while I was there too. Now, about the surrounding area. During the day, theres plenty of hustle and bustle. No need to feel afraid to roam the streets. Juniors restaurant is very close. Juniors is a diner thats famous for their cheesecake. There are also plenty of pizza shops to buy a slice of pie. To go downtown Manhattan, the Jay St. subway station is just a couple streets over from the hotel. Brooklyn Heights is a very nice area that you can get to on foot. To get into eastern part of Brooklyn, walk to Myrtle Ave. and take the B54 into Ridgewood. This is during the day. At night, you have to be more cautious. The area is dark and deserted. Keep in mind when returning to your hotel. The area is in transition with lots of construction going on. The price of this hotel is much cheaper than in Manhattan and quality of hotel is probably better, as well. I enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to stay here again."

After being shuffled around and continuously on hold with the hotel and Reservations, i finally was informed that i could not cancel nor reschedule my visit unless there was a mandatory visitor evacuation of Key West. After reviewing information from the National Hurricane Center (coupled with my 30 years of living in South Florida), i realized that it was highly likely that a visitor evacation would occur sometime during my stay. Numerous times i was told by the Belvoir's resident meteriologists that this would never happen. I told them what a predicament this left me in being unable to cancel or reschedule. I would have to begin my travels on friday morning, a 4 hour+ drive from Fort Lauderdale (our friends from Baltimore were traveling a much greater distance to reach us first of course). If an evacuation was ordered while driving down i would have to turn around. If it occurred after i got there, it could be an 8 hour drive for nothing. But instead of offering me to reschedule or cancel so that i could go to another Belvoir in say Orlando, Holly at the front desk told me that's why people get Travel Insurance. So given my predicament and the condescending attitudes, it was either travel 4+ hours on friday with the hopes of being able to stay more than 24 hours or sacrifice 24,000 points and several hundred dollars on the 2nd suite i also reserved (trying my best to not be specific)."

I am definitely not going back there again the conditions are deplorable and the hotel quality standards have declined over the last four years. I'm also disappointed with the toll free customer service line which could not elaborate on whether we were enrolled to stay using redeemed points or credit transactions. After my disappointment while staying at Belvoir Columbus suites I was further aggravated with a credit card deduction rather than my points being redeemed.

Reluctantly I went out for dinner only to find upon my return that noone had been to the room. It was rather late and having had a long day I decided to deal with the issue the next morning. The matter was worsened when I found that the bath towels had an even stronger mildew smell, especially when wet. It was so strong that I felt it was leaving the same odor on my skin. My complaints came with a response that someone would come replace my linens. My sheets were replaced the next day while I was out at meetings but the nicely folded, clean looking towels again were horrific smelling when wet.

I had made reservations in JAN for this hotel. Upon checking in I was told that they did not have a double bed room that I reserved that they only had a king bed with a chaise; so started my horrible experience. I told the girl that would not do and she went and got her manager Kenny. Kenny and basically says the same thing and I ask HOW if I reserved a room 6 months ago and you not have it. He told me he could try and explain it but it didnt matter because they didnt have it. He said it with such attitude and condensation that caused me to get angrier at this situation. He then tried to blame it on the dance convention we were attending and I told him that wasnt going to work since it was Belvoir I had booked with. He told me it would be the next day before they would have a room with a double bed and that I would need to contact them in the morning and be in my room so they could get us moved over. We took the room they had and I left to join the group. Upon talking to another mom in my group she was told they didnt have a room ready but that the housekeeping staff was behind and it would be ready soon and they offered her $50 off per night she was there. She and I went back to the desk so someone could tell me why I was told something different and why nothing was offered to me as a discount. Spoke with Kenny AGAIN and got the same answer with the same attitude that the other mothers witnessed as well. Lucky for me another mom in our group said that the room we got would be better for them and we were able to switch, NOTE I FIXED THE ISSUE NOT Belvoir!!!!!! The following say I called down to find out the status of the fridge we had requested since as well that had not been received. I had been told the night before that there was a waiting list and I should get one soon. Of course when I called down and spoke to an agent who got me manager on duty Luke he didnt have me on the waiting list. He and I spoke at length about the previous night and how I fixed the problem myself and he told me they would allow me to keep my credit of $50/ per night. I laughed ALLOW ME that wasnt even a question anymore. He told me he would call me back in 15 minutes about the refrigerator. He did and told me it would be brought to our room in 15 minutes. 45 minutes later I call back down and get someone in guest services I asked to speak to Luke she asked if she could help and I said no I need to speak to Luke, She transferred me and I got his voicemail. I called back got the same lady and she gave me her manager who got on the phone and was yelling (the other mother with us in the room could hear her across the room) at me about how Luke shouldnt have promised me anything. I said he did and she said well she would just get me the General Manager Finally I thought No, I got his VM so I called back to ask to have him paged or something and I again got the same guest services lady who told me, Ms we cannot just get him out of a meeting to talk to you I will leave a message with his secretary and she HUNG UP ON ME!!!! I grabbed me hotel key and set off to find the manager myself I was directed to the 4th floor and got to talk to him face to face.. He apologized and spoke very frank which I appreciated and I thought things were solved. We enjoyed the rest of our trip, got my bill before we left and saw that they would credit me and home we came Its now 2 months later and I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT ON MY BILL!!!
