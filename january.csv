Perhaps most concerning, though, was the knock on the door in the morning from some middle-aged women claiming to be housekeeping and holding what looked like a key card (a master perhaps) while still wearing a coat and carrying a handbag.

From the time we got off of the elevator we smelled a horrible musk smell and the hallway looked more like a motel than a nice hotel. The top problem was that we were obviously on a floor with all dogs. For starters I did not know dogs were even allowed in the hotel! We had constant barking all night long and morning! So much for my romantic getaway... The bathroom needed to be remolded terribly bad and the most disgusting part of the room was the nasty floor.

And although the hotel staff is wonderful, there were some shortcomings that could have been prevented. (1) I stayed in a suite, which I would never do again. Why? Because all the suites, I was told, are next to the elevator. And to make things worse, the bedroom is located adjacent to the elevator shaft. And worse yet, the bed's headboard abuts the elevator shaft wall so all you hear is the elevator going up and down until the wee hours of the morning. So if you are a light sleeper, you can forget about getting a good night's sleep. (2) The sofa in the suite is worn out, it's too deep and there are no pillows to rest against, making the sofa virtually impossible to really use comfortably. (3) the remote for the TV in the living room wouldn't work; had to request a new one and it took several attempts for housekeeping to bring one that would work. (4) I was given access to the lounge on the 16th floor, I assume because of my Gold Preferred Status. And on a few visits, the food wasn't being replenished and it required me having to call the front desk and being told to go to the restaurant for breakfast, albeit complimentary. (5) New Year's Eve was a debacle in the making. It was like a university's dormitory with all the noise that lasted until about 3am with kids being allowed to run up and down the hallways yelling at each other, doors repeatedly being slammed, etc. I called the front desk about it, they were sympathetic but obviously didn't have the ability to stop it. (6) then there was the couple in the adjacent room (locked door connecting our two rooms) who decided that everyone needed to hear them having relations at 2am with the woman reciting lines from a cheap adult movie for about 30 minutes. I'm only grateful that my 14 year old daughter wasn't staying with me at the time."

Being a loyal BPG member and having had many enjoyable experiences at Grandbourne properties around the world, we choose the Belvoir and I was able to use BPG points...even better. I immediately was concerned as I checked in and had a very rude valet person. Whatever...it's new years eve and I am sure this young person does not want to be working, the staff that checked me in was very nice and even mentioned they upgraded me. When I arrived at my room there were two men that appeared to be replacing a television that was missing from the wall. I was just dropping off my bags and they assured me that they needed to get some brackets and would get a tv to hook up. We returned to the hotel late that night and I noticed a few things...one NO TV..two a mess around where there should be a tv.....and three NO note explaining why there is no tv. I called the front desk and got answer after many rings. What kind of upgrade is this? Wife and I were looking very forward to a little room service in the morning and a little TV....not something you ever get with little ones at home. I know this i seems small, the room was relatively clean outside of the mess from the people that were supposed to put the tv, the bed was not the sweet sleeper that they mentioned on the website when i signed up(another disappointment and misleading advertisement). We stayed here to expect Grandbourne quality (I have stayed in over 100 Grandbournes around the world) and this is not what was delivered. I am actually very disappointed I was charged for not getting what I signed up for. There are many great hotels in downtown fort worth and at least in this experience this did not live up to one of them."

After a few moments, one agent, Nathalie, finally looked up to check me in. I had booked a club-level room. When Nathalie checked me in, she told me that I had been ""upgraded"" to a deluxe room. I asked her whether this was a room on the club level, since of course a deluxe room not on the club would be a downgrade rather than an upgrade to my reservation. She explained that they were ""enhancing"" the club level and were not assigning any guests to that floor, even though the reservation system of course was selling rooms as ""club level"". I told her that I would not pay the club level rate to stay in a non-club room (even if they would provide access to the lounge), so she called another agent over. The other agent quickly informed her that she was wrong and went ahead and assigned me to the club level room, since the ""enhancements"" had been completed several days before. So, in other words, Nathalie caused this whole issue for no reason by being ill-informed about the status of the enhancements to the hotel. What I resented the most, however, is that she tried to dupe me into thinking that I had received an ""upgrade"" when in fact I had been downgraded. She also tried to tell me that the non-club room to which she was assigning me would have the same amenities as a club room (like the bathrobe, slippers, bottled water, etc), which of course is not true--the website specifically lists these as club level room- only benefits.

Here's how to kill your hotel with Platinum guests - start with sending a message suggesting we spend 30% more for a ""club level"" room. If it's available Platinum is supposed to get upgraded. At check-in be told you've been upgraded (but not to the best available) because access to your floor is restricted. Of course the room is the same size, amenities are the same, and it is exactly the same as non-""restricted"" floors, but HEY! it's an upgrade! By the way, that ""welcoming gift""? You better want points because the front desk staff is going to give you an alternative by asking. Go to your room and find they've ignored your requests for extra towels and pillows. (This is guaranteed or compensated in other plans folks!) Now ask for those additional items and have the person delivering only the towels drop them off and just leave without a word. What a stupid guest, you should have KNOWN those extra pillows were in a bag in the closet (where they may have been for the last 6 months for all you know.) Check the next day, and find out there's an entire floor of much larger, nicer rooms on the executive level. And guess what? They are available for your entire stay. Now be told you can reserve that level next time (at additional cost of course.) So much for the upgrade, but we're not done. Now if you really want to put a dagger in the hotel's Platinum heart, have one of your keys not work. Then send your spouse down with your Platinum key-jacket to get one that does. Can you see this coming? The staff person keeps the non-working key and says you need your ID (that's back up in the room) because they want to be security conscious. The Platinum jacket isn't enough because you might have found or stolen it. It doesn't matter that they talked to you less than 24 hours ago and heard your complaints then. Please, Platinum member, we must abuse you just a bit more. Stayed here more than 10 years and probably close to 50 times but I'm done. I recommend you stay away from here if you are an elite member who knows how a property is SUPPOSED to treat you. They didn't even send a manager to talk to me."

This specific time they were full and my platinum status resulted in a room quite far from the lobby that had opened water bottles, vanity not wiped down and security latch on the sliding door broken. All of these things were disappointing and made me realize how much more I actually get as a Platinum guest."

The first time I was told I need wait another several days; the second time I was told who entered the transaction would contact me but it never happened; the third time I was told that my inquiry would be directed to Research Department and I need to wait another 7 to 10 business days to get answer.

When I got to the hotel, they couldn't find my reservation at all. They only gave me a room because I had a printed out copy of my confirmation. Then they didn't acknowledge me as a preferred guest. They didn't even want to honor the room rate that I received. Thank GOD I had a printed out slip. They then put me in a tiny room, with Shower only (which I did not book) and the comforter had a black stain. I was totally embarrassed!! I will never go back there again!!"
