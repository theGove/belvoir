For the star rating and listed price, didn't expect paper cups, dinged up furniture and 80s beige theme. The air in the hotel was stale, and my wife in I took deep breaths of relief when outside, which is saying something in Pittsburgh. Biggest complaints: 1) Room heater was wildly erratic,and more like what I would expect in a cheap motel. Room was cool but turning up heat to highest setting only brought up heat a few degrees, over several hours. Turned it down, to below the setting where it had been cool, when going to bed, then woke in the middle of the night at what felt like 100 degrees, which gave me a severe headache. Had to turn on AC, which worked well."

While travelling for a conference, I had only a few spare hours to spend at a nearby park. A fellow hotel guest/conference attendee and myself went to Guest Services to buy tickets. Not being from the area, we would hope they could cordially help us understand what our options were in terms of pricing and transportation. This seemed to be a major inconvenience for them as we received one-word answers to our questions, enormous attitude (I was told to ""be quiet"" at one point) and ultimately were disrespected as the two women, Ruth and Mabel, talked about us negatively as we were standing right in front of them. They told us they didn't believe us that we were hotel guest/conference attendees and assumed we were trying to scam discounted tickets. We then went to the Concierge and were helped by two of the hotels most welcoming and helpful employees, Amanda and Justin. They were also treated rudely by Ruth and Mabel themselves as they tried to assist us while buying tickets.

The only downside is the ageing of the rooms. The furniture was outdated, and the curtains were cut to allow room for an old-school air con vent which allowed a lot of light in from the minute the sun was up.

Then we were instructed to go upstairs with no apology and the alarm was still going so we had to try to go to sleep with the alarm still ringing for 15-20 minutes after we got back to our room. Really poor communication and execution of a plan to guests who were greatly inconvenienced by this incident (there were many families affected with small children for example). Again, the incident was not the hotel's fault, but a situation like this is when a hotel's staff has a chance to shine in how they handle it.

This stay was sub par across the board.,4,The worst customer service received at a Belvoir to date.,"First of all, I have stayed here before, I have given this hotel a good review in the past, and obviously every stay can be different. Unfortunately this stay was, and currently is not up to par. The whole reason for this negative review is customer service. My wife checked us into the hotel as I had to stay late at our office. I will say its my fault I did not put her on the reservation so she had a hard time checking in. Once checked in she was ""upgraded"" to a room that did not appear to have been cleaned. At this point she did not want to deal with the hotel because of her ordeal checking in so I called in from the office. The person on the phone was quite rude to me and in a very glib tone tells me ""well sir, she is more than welcome to go down to the front desk at any time to change rooms"" Okay, I say well can you move her to a club floor lounge as we are platinum members. He says there is room, so my wife goes downstairs and she is moved not to the club floor but to another lower level room in the other towers, she is not excited but at least it is clean. I called in to speak with the manager about all this and am told she is busy, Okay so I leave a message. I am not even given the courtesy of a return call to my message. Frankly I am floored. My wife likened it to feeling like she ""booked on priceline"" and was given the second class citizen treatment. There are several 4 star hotels in downtown Seattle that are cheaper; we book at BPG properties for our platinum status, and the service that comes along with an BPG property. The ball was dropped, and dropped miserably on this stay. Again, this is not a comment on the hotel as a whole, its a comment on how we were treated this stay. Maybe it didnt help that we stayed at a St. Regis the night before, but should not all BPG properties aspire to have that level of customer service?"

We turned on the air unit only to have it blowing hot air although we had adjusted the temperature to 68 degrees. After about 30 minutes in the room only warm air was blowing, we called the front desk and advised them of our problem and they stated that it would be taken care of prior to our return that evening. My wife and I arrived around 3am that morning only to find the room at around 90 degrees plus. We contacted the front desk once again to voice our concerns and we were placed in another room. We adjusted the temperature in this room to 70 degrees only to find out that the hotel had control over the AC units independently and warm air was still blowing. We woke up about 10am that morning and my wife was showering, she rotated the water temperature handle only to have it get stuck on her in the hot mode and she quickly wrapped the shower curtain around her to avoid scorching. I immediately went to the front desk and asked for the manager as this was getting frustrating having issues with each room we were placed into. The manager sadly to say did not show any remorse to what was happening to us only that she would send someone to take care of it. The manager was a tad bit prudent so I contacted BPG customer service who managed to take care of the situation for us. We were provided with some hotel comps and a 7th floor room.

At first there was a period of 3 nights we would have to go and stay elsewhere because they were fully booked but I checked a couple of times and in the end I was able to get the whole 12 nights here and I am so glad. We had 2 ocean front rooms booked so the teenagers could have thier own room and we all had a little more space from each other. We had an interconnecting door which was great because we only closed it at bedtime and every other time we were in the rooms it was like we were all together anyway. We honestly could not complain about anything during our stay. We were happy with the rooms on the 19th floor overlooking the infinity pool which was great. The ocean looks so blue and amazing when you look out. At night you can kick back on the balcony and listen to the music below or watch the firedancer show. Beds are so comfy and the hotel staff are so friendly always saying aloha as you pass them in the hallway. The staff at the travel desk are so helpful in booking or reconfirming any day tours.

I left a note on the bed asking the maids to change my linens, but they didn't do it, they just made up the bed with the same sheets. I asked for a shower cap, but they didn't have any.

You should have a mini fridge in each room to give your guests the choice of purchasing your overpriced items or bringing their own. I also think that $14 for a glass of white wine is ludicrous (at the downstairs bar). These prices only make staying at a hoetel unattainable to some. It's no wonder I only can afford to do it through the company I work for.
