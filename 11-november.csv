I called the front desk to express my concern about being so close to the noise of people coming and going at the elevators and waited as the phone rang and rang, for over 10 minutes on 2 different attempts to reach someone.

When we drove up to the curb, the bellmen ignored us--despite that it was pouring rain and snow (Oct 30 storm). I had to get out of the car and ask for help. The bellman said he would help me, so I went back to the car. 10 mins later, he was still tending to other people, hailing cabs. I got out of the car again, to ask for help AGAIN and he said ""oh yeah"", as if he forgot about me. This was my first impression of the generally unprofessional attitude of the staff. I then waited to 20 mins to check in, just to be told that I could not do so until 3pm! There was only two people checking in dozens and dozens of guests, but the staff were still working at a SNAILS PACE! No sense of urgency at all. I then went to see where my luggage was, so I could figure out what to do with it and was told it would be taken to the storage room until we could check in later. We left and came back later, to check in. Upon return, I waited for another 30 mins in line, just to be told that because I did not have a ticket for my luggage, I could not get it out of the storage room! I walked around, trying to find someone to help me with the situation and saw my luggage just sitting on a luggage cart, in the middle of the lobby! I was furious. We went up to our room and decided to stay indoors, since the storm was so bad outside. Then entire rest of the night, we were awoken by drunken Halloween partiers, because the door was too small from the frame and there was a 1/2 inch gap, which allowed all of the hallway noise to funnel into our room. The next morning, we were up early. We did not have a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, but did not think that the housekeeping crew would bother us so early. Wrong. We heard a knock at the door at 8:45. Before we could answer, she just let herself in! I couldn't even believe it. I was so happy when we finally left. NOT a good experience, what-so-ever."

In the lobby, you can check out the new fabric, paint chips and floor plan for the renovations, but dont expect to see them anywhere else. The gym, however, just reopened after a major renovation.

Horrible food, no snacks during the day, no sweets in the evening, no cream for the coffee during the day (sorry, CoffeeMate doesn't cut it). Cheap, cheap, cheap and I had to pay a hefty sum to get access to this poor excuse for a lounge? The service people were very unfriendly, they don't care about keeping the customer happy. They sucker you into not having your room cleaned in exchange for a $5.00 coupon daily for use at their restaurants but its like pulling teeth trying to get the coupons! I was unable to use mine because when I wanted to have dinner in their restaurant, they wouldn't give me the coupons to use! So, I wound up going to a restaurant outside of the hotel. I happen to carry a lot of clout about recommending where drug companies hold their meetings and I can assure you, based on my negative experience at this hotel, it will not be a Belvoir. I wanted to join their rewards program upon check-in but the service person was aloof and had no idea of benefits offered or what it takes to get upgrades. But she had no problem charging me a lot extra for the lounge. I mentioned that I just wanted a look see to compare with other executive lounges that I'm accustomed to, but she said the only way to gain access was by paying the fee. I asked another service person about the location of a nearby restaurant and was pointed in the direction of across the street. He was not specific and it took me 20 minutes to find, very frustrating. I could go on and on but I really did not have a good time at this hotel.

We called multiple times to the main desk to ask what was being done but I was met with frustrated attendants and very short tempers. The music did not stop until well past 11pm and I had to wake up at 5am to run in the marathon at 7am.
