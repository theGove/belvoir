I don't know why Belvoir would allow dogs on the 3rd floor, or why someone would take their pet to Disneyland? I will not be staying at this property again! Even though I am complaining about the property, the staff were great! Kudos to them!</td></tr>

I reserved the room for 4 people yet EVERYDAY I had to ask for more towels as they only put 3 in each day. Elevator is about the slowest I have ever seen!!! There is ONE dryer and ONE washer for the entire hotel( there are 14 floors) needless to say it was NEVER open. (we were there for over a week) Front desk staff was hit or miss, some were great others were down right rude. Suggestions would be to have a hotel guest parking lot and one for the conference rooms as every night they had something going on at the hotel and I as a paying guest had to park pretty much in the car lot next door each night. BUT the breakfast was delicious and location (close to a ton of restraunts, mall, major freeways) was great!</td></tr>

For the price of the room there should have been some type of free breakfast instead it was average cost of 22.00 per person as was quoted to me over the phone from room service. Friday and Saturday night the bar closed early according to listing in my room. However, when I called to double check I was told bar closes at 1:30am went down at 12midnight approximately 5 minutes after my phone call and was informed the bar was closed. After that I barely stayed in the room parking was not convenient after a certain point in the night and it proved easier and more relaxing to stay elsewhere. Just was not worth the price and I will never recommend.</td></tr>

Staying at a Belvoir seemed to be a good start. The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional and the 1st and 2nd floor of the hotel are nice. The rooms are an absolute disappointment and over-priced. We had to have the exhaust fan fixed, the windows are cloudy and didn't seal properly so they leaked air and water. The carpet needs to be professionaly cleaned. The window ledge had water damage and we had to keep our 1 yr old from picking at it and eating the paint. After we checked in, we found out that you will be nickle and dimed to death. All of these are indicators that this hotel has seen it's best days behind it and is headed downhill. The other hotel we stayed at, for a cheaper price, was far better than this hotel. I feel bad for the hard working staff at this location.</td></tr>

About a week prior to that we decided to come down a day early. I called your hotel to book a room for th 26th as well. I was told that your hotel was booked. I then went on Hotwire and booked a hotel room for that night instead. Once I confirmed the reservation I was told by Hotwire that it was your hotel that I was being booked at. This was of course after I was told by your staff that the hotel was book. The first room we were given for the 26th was a nightmare. There were people hanging out in the hallway until 10:30 at night. When that noise finally died down the room next to us exploded with children screaming and running around the room until 1:00 in the morning. I have never stayed in a hotel that was that loud. It sounded like these people were in the same room as we were. I had my two small children with me and none us go to sleep until after 1:00 a.m. When I checked out of that room in the morning and into our original reservation I told the front desk how disatisfied I was with our room and the experience thus far with your hotel. All I received was a "Sorry". Our next room was nice and much more quiet. However, when we booked that reservation we booked it to include breakfast in the morning. The breakfast was a joke. Unless you got there at 6:00 a.m. there was no food left. We ended up eating in the restaurant the next day and waited 45 minutes for an omlette. I will say we did enjoy the pool, however that is about where our happiness with this stay ends.</td></tr>

I emailed them about the airport shuttle service about how it works, The only response was the manager would be back 2 days later, but I did not receive any till now. What really surprised me was that when I called to cancel one night due to the change of flight, I was told that the room I reserved was not available. I really don not understand why I booked two nights half a month ago and it became not available to me. At last their representative canceled all my reservation, which means I had to book another hotel. All in all, the experience with Belvoir at Salt Lake City was unbelievably disappointing. I would not suggest this hotel at all.</td></tr>

I thought the room rate for this hotel was overpriced and I consider it to be a 3 star hotel. I was there for an event 0n the evening of July 28, [YEAR-0] for which the group rate was outrageously high for one night, I feel I was robbed. The group rate especially for the event and the organization that gave the event at this hotel was very excessive due to the fact that most of the people there were from the tri-state area and not tourist. The rate should have been no much less per night, the organization which I dont want to name can clearly pack this entire hotel if the rates were better, Im coming to an event here in December but if the rates arent cheaper Ill stay at home which is only 15 minutes off the expressway. I have stayed with this organization at other hotels in New Jersey and Wilmington Delaware and paid much less per night for the same type of and/or holiday event. One thing I would like to say also during the time of the even there was lady with a radio who looked to be in charge and a young man also with a radio. These two persons were working their butts off. Everywhere they were needed, anything that they were able to help they were there and they looked to make sure everything was running as smooth as possible. I give both of these people BIG TIME PROPS, they were very nice and friendly even if under pressure you couldnt tell because they always had a smile on their faces. I wish I knew their names (Caucasian stocky woman and thin African American young man) to put in this feedback but Im sure you know who they are. My room was the downer for me. My room looked as if someone was sleeping in my bed before I got there. I actually thought I was mistakenly placed in an occupied room. It was very un-appealing and un-inviting. The towels in the bathroom were folded but thrown on the towel racks and I had only one wash cloth and I didn't even have one of those small boxed shower caps. I was very disappointed with this. I know Belvoir to have great hotels but this one has not changed very much over the past 10 years. It was actually better when it was the under another name. I figure in time things will get much better.</td></tr>

I arrived on Sat. around 12 and while I didn't assume a room would be ready , I was disappointed by how events unfolded. The hotel was fully booked and I was asked for a contact #. I checked after a few hours and there was still no room available. Finally, I checked again at 5 p.m. and was given a choice to wait an undetermined amount of time for my room or take a different, but available one. I decided to take the room that was ready. I would have really appreciated an update at some point instead of having to check myself with no phone contact from staff for 5 hours. Also, I wonder if there was any increased staffing to accommodate the full bookings and turn rooms over more quickly. Also, the elevators seemed like they were running way too slow for the number of guests. These things marred what would have been an otherwise great experience. Summary - great staff and hotel during most times, but avoid when hotel is busy/full.</td></tr>

When arriving, the front desk was pleasant and helpful. Elizabeth was great and even knew my name when I needed a key to the room as I locked myself out. The biggest draw for my family is the pool facility. Having two energized boys the zero entry pool, water spouts, whirlpools, and of course the water slide kept them entertained when we got back from Disney. They also have a LCD projector and in the pool area show movies. We saw the Olympics in prime time on a few nights. They also have a good assortment of food and drinks at the bar at reasonable prices. As for the room we got a standard two queen beds. It was a decent size and was recently renovated. Another bonus is the shuttle to Disney Parks. We used in mainly in afternoon/evening as we wanted to arrive early in the park. Service was good and we were one of the first stops on the way back to the hotels.</td></tr>

I made the reservation initally as only 2 nights then decided to call back and check availability for a 3rd night. Luckily, there was availability so I changed the reservation to 3 nights. I was told that the reservations would be 'linked' and I wouldn't have to move, etc. To my surprise, I received 2 separate email confirmations for the reservations a week or so prior to the stay. When I arrived, the person checking me in said there were 2 reservations. She proceeded to tell me nothing about the hotel, the area, or offerings of the hotel. When I get to the room, I look down and there are Fritos or some such snack on the floor at the door. I was flabbergasted. There were ants or some insect crawling around near the sink under the microwave. The comforter which was folded up in the closet was filthy. The cushion on the chaise in the living room was filthy....it had what appeared to be punch or something red. This is why I attempted to spread the comforter over it. On Monday morning, I received a bill under the door. At the pool, I ordered a fruit plate. The fruit (some of it) didn't smell/taste fresh. The dining room seating (outside) was not clean. Where my daughter and I sat, hair was all over the couch. Some of the towels were overly worn. There was dust/dirt on the base boards in the room. I purchased tickets for a tour and the trolley either left without us or never came. I never got an explanation but was not charged. Upon check out, I had to struggle with the luggage cart and luggage. I was never asked if I needed help. I was not asked how the stay was, etc. The trip was ruined upon check-in. I am skeptical about myBPG membership and shudder to think about future vacations. The first vacation was nothing short of disastrous.</td></tr>

The waitress was rude and impatient. Although we understand this is a quite large event to manage, a bit smile on the face and a responsive answer could make a huge difference. It was clear that the waitress was not happy to come to work to begin with. There was no smile from the beginning. When we simply asked for hot tea, she seemed distrubed by this request and it took 5-6 follow ups to make this happen. It was unbelievable how rude she was during this period, she would cut off you when you were trying to friendly remind her and eventually threw the tea pot to the table and left without even asking everyone who would like to have the tea. I was shocked and quite disappointed. I hope this is one instance off and Belvoir will be able to show that not only it can serve all guests well but also it can handle big events like this well.</td></tr>

A maintenance man came up and said he reset the air conditioning assured me that all was fine. At 2:15am we called the front desk again telling them that we were burning up. Another maintenance man came in there and told us the room temperture was 78 even though we had the air set on 65. He tried to fix the air conditioning. Another maintenance man came up and we were told that we should call the front desk so we could move rooms. So I did....now this is 2;30 in the morning not very convenient at all to be dragging our luggage down to another floor and once again get all the beds set up. We had to use a pull out to accomodate us. The room was stuffy when we got in there and it took a good 30 mins for it to cool off. When I spoke to the girl at the front desk she told me that they had a complaint about the air conditioning previously. I was shocked to hear this...when you pay $260 a night for a room you expect to be given a room that is in working condition. I was very disappointed with this hotel as a whole.</td></tr>

Keauhou Bay was very quiet Waikiki was very busy, lots of people moving around, shopping enjoying the property. We loved both experiences. Waikiki is within walking distance of everything. Location was GREAT! We ate at all 3 restaurants at the hotel. The breakfast buffet at the Kai Market was awesome and so was the price! It's such a great incentive for kids under 12 to eat free. We enjoyed the Pineapple soft serve at the coffee shop. My kids loved the pool and the beach. We had a deluxe oceanview room where I got the most amazing pictures! I have NO complaints whatsoever. My daughters are 7 & 4. They have gotten to know and LOVE the Belvoir and I'll be sure to stay with Belvoir where ever we go. Thanks for giving us such great memories :) Mahalo!</td></tr>

We had to cool our heels in the bar and informed they would call us as soon as a room was ready. Three hours passed and even the bartender apologized for the delay.

Stay began with a preregistered check-in and had assistance with my luggage into a most lovely king executive suite. The Belvoir At The Falls valued this BPG member with exceptional recognition. The king executive suite on the BPG floor exceeded my expectations for both cleanliness and amenities. The carpet was freshly shampooed upon my arrival, and later on that evening, a beautiful welcoming amenity was delivered to the room. Both TGI Friday's and the Jade Room for breakfast the next morning provided me with outstanding cuisine and service. The BPG Club Level had a most wonderful evening reception with many wonderful wine and food selections. No other hotel anywhere has ever provided me with a more personalized level of service from Guest Services to Food and Beverage. The Housekeeping was exceptional in that the room was equipped with every amenity one could want and more. Most importantly, I felt extremely valued and appreciated due to my previous business at Belvoir At The Falls. A special thank you to the entire Belvoir At The Falls staff and management for a welcome to Lewiston, NY that I will never forget for the rest of my life. For a most memorable stay that will always exceed ones' expectations, stay at Belvoir At The Falls because the entire staff is completely dedicated to total guest satisfaction! The staff truly cares about the guest as an individual, not as a folio number! The king executive suite had most beautiful furnishings as well.</td></tr>

To my surprise, our room was ready, and we were allowed to check in then (SO much nicer than having to leave everything in the car and drag it in after a full day with 2 children at an amusement park at 9:30 in the evening)!

It soon became obvious that no one could help me. The 5th time I spoke to the front desk in person. That shift told me to talk to the next shift. When I did that, I was told that they didn't know there had been a problem, and that I could use the computer in the office center, which timed out every 45 min. I was trying to work, so that was annoying. Also, I was staying at the hotel, because my husband was running a 100 mile race, and I couldn't check on his progress, without the internet. I would think that since this race is an annual race, and runners and their families were staying at the hotel, the staff would do everything it could to be involved with this community activity. I only received an apology once from a front desk staff who happened to overhear my complaint. So, that is my second issue, lack of communication and followup. This hotel is supposed to be a resort, but it looked better than it functioned.</td></tr>

I was there in a conference group rate which was still over priced so the regular price is out of this world for what you get. It was really just a lot of little things that made the price just not match the quality of hotel the Belvoir is supposed to be. For example I had to slam my door every time I shut it in order to get it to close (rm 605), my toilet seat would not stay up which was very inconvenient when I had to pee. I brought food for my meals to warm up and there was no microwave for me to do that. They charge $20 to have one brought to your room no matter how long the stay. Again I understand all of these examples are just small but they are the type of things you would not expect to see at a Hotel that you pay that much for and one that has a rep like the Belvoir.

In my room the TV was not working until maintenance came. I stay at BPG hotels more than 60 nights a year and mostly Belvoirs. This is my second time at this hotel in about 18 months. The first stay was disappointing. This one was unacceptable. The hotel is well out of date and right in the flight path (noisy). To top it all off, the fire alarm went off at 5:30 am. When I called the front desk I was told that they did not know where the problem was but to "stay in your room." I told them to check the kitchen since breakfast service starts at 6:00. Sure enough. That's where the problem was. In 10 minutes the alarm was silenced -- but I was awake. Nice staff cannot make up for poor operations.</td></tr>

We were very happy with the staff at the hotel. They were very pleasant, knowledgeable and responsive to our needs. For example, the iron in our room was not functioning. A call to the front desk and I had a new iron brought to the room within 15 minutes, very impressive! The room was very clean and in good condition, newly renovated I believe, although a little small, but this is expected in NYC hotels. My only complaint about the room was that the closet was a bit difficult to manage, it is not designed to allow for many hanging clothes. Also there were no drawers in which to store clothes. The closet had just a small table with 2 shelves in it. It would even have been better if it had drawer fronts on it. It was fine for a short stay but for an extended stay the lack of drawers would be very frustrating. The full length mirror is awkwardly place in the closet which my wife found frustrating. The room had a 42 inch T.V. which was nice. The area around the hotel is generally safe, during the day I had no concerns, but I would be a bit more alert if walking late at night on Fulton Mall in the immediate area of the hotel. The hotel has good interior security and requires a room key to access the elevators. There are 3 nearby subway stations and allowed easy access to multiple lines. The only downside of this location is the difficulty in getting Taxi's. We got lucky that a taxi had been coming down Duffield street as we were leaving the Hotel, but getting one is hit or miss. It is not like getting a Taxi in Manhattan. So if you are late for something and need a taxi expect to either walk a few blocks or hope someone is being dropped off at the hotel. There is a roof top club at the Hotel that is just above the club floor. I appreciated that the staff accommodated our request to be moved down to a lower floor (22 rather than 25) I was willing to trade the club level for the assurance of a good nights sleep on the preferred guest floor. It was very quiet and we were never disturbed by the music. There are many nearby restaurants in the area as you head west towards the Heights.</td></tr>

I asked for a room change (broke out into hives and started sneezing) which wasnt able to happen that night but they were able to accommodate me the next day.

Not at this hotel!</td><td>When I arrived at the hotel I was told the hotel was "full" and finding a room with my bed preference would be difficult. I had a reservation in advance and was surprised at this given I was an BPG member. When I got to my room in the "older" wing of the hotel, I noticed a person was sitting on the room patio. It was a cook with the hotel, and his entire grill/cooking set-up with chaffing dishes, outside my patio door. There was a party about to take place directly outside my door. As a business traveler with an early meeting, I immediately requested a room change. It took approx 20 minutes before a new key arrived for my next room. When I got to the next room, the AC was broken. While the room was quiet, and hot, it was also dirty. There were stains on the carpet and the fabric of the shower curtain. There was hair on the bathroom floor and what appeared to be a blood stain in the drain area of the tub. At this point it was getting late, I was on my second room, and I was ready to eat dinner. The person I was traveling with, also an BPG Gold Member, checked in with similar room problems. We both decided to stick it out for night and grab some dinner before it was too late. When we left for dinner, we discovered that when they transferred our rooms, they did not move our parking validation to the new room key. So we could not exit the parking structure. We rang for assistance and were first interrogated over the speaker phone by the attended. When he realized we could not get out of the parking structure with our current keys he came out to meet us. He was rude in responses to us and told us to "take it up" with the front desk people to fix our key. When we returned from dinner, we stopped at the front desk and told them what happened in the parking garage and advised about the rude employee. They said they would fix it and re-keyed us. In the morning when we went to check out, they tried to charge us twice for parking! After explaining what happened the night before the front desk person actually asked me how my stay was.. I told them dissapointing. Not once did she ask if there was something that could be improved or even tried to get any further information. She just handed me my receipt. The entire stay with the hotel was a dissapointment. I recently joined BPG membership and aquired an BPG AMEX credit card. I am a member of a competing preferred guest program. This experiece does not even come close to the same quality as similiar programs.</td></tr>

I call the front desk to complain & they send up a maid with sheets. Placing them over couch & chair- BUT the sheets have stains too! Walls had handprints on them. The lamp in room has a clear base, it looked like it had never been cleaned! The drinking glasses were smudged not clean. The cords from snack case were sticking out all on floor. TO TOP IT OFF, it was extremely noisy from other guests very late at night/early morning & we could even hear the flushing of toilets from other rooms! This room was over $150 & I've stayed at cleaner $40 rooms in Vegas than this! PLUS, parking was $22?!!! & then we had to wait for parking attendant each time we wanted to leave or come in because our room key would not work on the "automatic gate".

I travel for a living, and stay in hotels, both foreign and domestic, 3, 4, 5 nights a week. When I can, I try to stay in BPG hotels because of the wonderful costomer service, and because I know I will be staying in a nice, clean, safe environment. This stay started off by waiting an hour and a half at the airport for the shuttle bus. When it picked me up at almost midnight, it was so full of other people who had been waiting just as long, that I was the last person it could hold. The driver had to turn away approximately forty other people, a lot of them families with children, to pick up later. This was just unacceptable. Then there was only one person working the reception desk, which slowed check in down to a crawl. I landed at ten p.m. and it was around two thirty a.m. when I finally got to my room, which wasn't all that great. The next day when I attempted to check out, the reception desk was understaffed again. I had to wait to check out because I never got my usual bill under my door and needed a hard copy for business reasons. After waiting behind a lady for almost half an hour, a group came in off a shuttle bus and someone came from the back to help them, but ignored me. Then, when the lady in fron of me was finally done, the girl behind the desk ignored me to wait on a girl who just walked in and rudely cut right in front of me. When she finally got to me and checked me out and I asked for a hard copy of my bill, she complained to me why didn't I just use the one from under my door? Really? I asked to speak to the manager, who of course was unavailable. BPG/Belvoir should take their name away from this hotel before it ruins their reputation.</td></tr>

I'm a frequent member of another large hotel chain and I get free parking, internet, happy hour drinks and breakfast.. - I was a little shocked since I have not stayed at a Belvoir in a while. Guess this hotel chain really isn't for the business traveler.</td></tr>

I contacted the hotel the night before my arrival and they were able to secure a reservation for me and were happy to do so, so kudos to their front office. Check in was a breeze and I was put on the top floor, which is the club floor. The room was very large and was clean. AC was quiet, which some people can be concerned about. About the only item that could be an issue is that bathrooms are pretty small...the door actually opens up and brushes against the toilet. For me, I was not concerned with this, but it is worth noting. The club room was very nice and I wish I had more time to hang out there. I grabbed a couple of wings and a beer and went back to my room before heading out for the evening. Wings were good, beer was cold, worked for me. I didn't check out the pool or eat in the restaurant, but it all looked very nice. I definitely like the lobby and bar area and will check that out the next time i'm in town.

While at the hotel, I received great service from the Belvoir staff. I have limited sightlegally blind and, thus, I appreciate assistance from supportive people. As I was checking-in to the hotel, I asked the clerk/reps for an easily accessible room -- that wouldnt require too much navigation for me to locate it. The front-desk reps were very responsive and facilitated my request. They were friendly and gave me additional information, verbally regarding the hotel layout and other important features on the premises. Also, a concierge provided particularly helpful and quick services; for example, she expeditiously got new washcloths for me, plus she patiently answered my other questions, and she carefully gave me verbal directions to some nearby points of interest ... enabling me to enjoy some of the local offerings there in Dallas. Several of the banquet staff also assisted me, as they informed me of all the beverages/nourishment available during the conference sessions. Some staff, in a few instances, kindly brought the selected hot tea and food back to my table. The friendly service was impressive to me. Good work deserves recognition. These staff well represent quality service, congruous with the Belvoir reputation. I was also personally assisted by a manager; when I was needing to get back to my room on the 4th floor, I asked a person near the elevator, who happened to be a manager, for assistance with the elevator, and he quickly helped me. He shows exemplary leadership. The North Olive Street Belvoir hotel staff demonstrated genuine care which is highly commendable. Please relay my gratitude to them all for their excellent service.

There are no laundry facilities on premises which was a big surprise - the cleaning service they offer is expensive. Had to find a local laundomat to wash clothes twice while I was there.

I informed the general manager, on his answering machine, with no response from him. I felt that level of service was unacceptable. He NEVER returned my call nor offered an apology for having a "long-term guest" (ME) doing the housekeeping duties. I stayed there last year for 2 weeks and did the same this year (had a 2nd reservation). I will miss the staff that ensured that my stay was pleasant, but management needs to get on board and make sure they are in touch with their guest. Because of the General Manager's response, or lack thereof, to me, the rating for this site is low. Unfortunately, I will NOT be returning to this hotel.

But I soon found out that If you don't want the bell hops and the valet thieves to help you when you check in, your treated like road kill. I went inside to check -in, they demanded the keys from my wife and just took my car without permission and parked it 1/2 of a block away. Leaving crying kids and upset family standing there. When I came out and asked where my car is they pointed in a general direction and said they had more important customers to take care off. When pressed they then said that my car was in the way so they moved it, It was were I was initially told to park it, out of the way of the front door but where I could still get my bags. Turns out I was talking to the so called valet supervisor (a sad commentary on Belvoir's personal) I finally got upset, only after I made a scene was able to get my car back so I could unload it.

The free continental breakfast in the club lounge was unimpressive; no hot breakfast items, instead were a small selection of hard, frozen bagels, muffins and other carb-heavy items in their place.

I must say that the garden for the wedding was lovely and the room, food, and service for the reception were very good.</td></tr>

Parking is at a cost everywhere and at every hotel. The Belvoir's fee is $20/night to park, but I feel if the rates are reasonable for the hotel (which this had when I booked), it's well worth the $$$ for the underground parking garage.</td><td>2</td><td>Second time stay</td><td>This was our second time staying at the Belvoir in Alexandria. After our first stay I had a few small issues, which were virtually non existent during this stay because obviously the management listens and tries very hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We came from NJ with extended family from Washington State. We had two rooms on the same floor. Both of the rooms were comfortable, spacious, and clean. Pool was closed for one day when we went down, which was not the fault of the hotel but someone who allowed their small child to swim in it without a proper swim diaper. They had to thorougly clean and shock the pool for everyone's health safety. Lifeguard was great to have but really should keep a better eye on the pool. One guard had headphones in and was on her computer while parents were allowing their small children in the whirlpool, and others were throwing a ball back and forth between the pool and whirlpool. . During our last stay, the lifeguard was so good, she wouldn't allow my 13 year old in. The sign specifically says ages 16 and up. Not only is it a safety hazard for small children to use a hot tub, but it makes it less enjoyable for the adults to use.Only suggestion I have again is to remove the non gratis water from the rooms because this is the second time we got charged for water that we didn't drink. We brought water from home but I think if the maid sees empty water bottles in the recycling pail or garbage, you get charged. If water is available for sale in the vending machines on the floor, there really is no need to put it in the rooms.</td></tr>

The front desk staff at The Dolphin (bryan/richard) were so pleasant and cheerful trully worthy of a Disney recognition. However, the food service and quality at Picaboo cafe needs to be elevated.

As we peeled back the covers, the wetness increased. It seems that the previous occupants had spilled something on the bed and that housekeeping had simply put dry sheets on it. The mattress itself was very wet and that wetness was seeping through the sheets and blankets. We called the front desk and were told to repack our belongings and come down to the front desk for another room assignment. The second room we were given was much smaller and without the amenities of the first room. I went back to the front desk and after much discussion they finally agreed to put us in a room that was the same quality as the first, but with two dry beds. We were told that a bellman would help us move our things since we'd had to move our things twice already. After waiting for 20 minutes we finally had to do it ourselves, as we had plans for the evening and couldn't wait any longer to get into our room. In all, check in took over an hour and a half. I was told that we'd be given 2000 star points to make up for the hassle, but those have not been credited to my account despite my calling several days ago to inquire. Also, in the room shuffle and the extra packing/unpacking we had to do we lost the top of an electric trimmer. I reported it missing Sunday at checkout and was told that I'd be called by Monday at the latest with information. By Wednesday I had still not been contacted so I had to follow up with the hotel. The woman I spoke with said they would look for it one more time and call me by the next day. As of Saturday morning I have still not heard anything. This lack of follow through is simply appalling.</td></tr>

Then we learned that you can only use it in the hotel for credit on food purchases and even more disappointing to learn that it expires on the day of departure. Pretty inconvenient to say the least and somewhat misleading language is used on the card promoting this service. It doesn't make it clear what the limitations are and you could a lot better to insure that guests know what to expect if they elect to use this service. I thought I could use the $10 in coupons for use in "other" venues, only to learn that they had to be used in the hotel on the day you depart. I did not want the other option of points for your chain as I don't usually stay at Belvoirs.

The hotel was extremely full, due to teen sports teams playing the weekend we were there. The staff was very accomodating, which made our potentially disasterous vacation, bareable. Upon going to our rooms the halls were a mess, not due to lack of staff doing their job, but due to the lack of consideration of the team coaches and parental guidance. Once these issues were reported, it was fixed immediately. It is very unfortunate that we have to deal with this type of behavior when coming to a hotel that we expect to get top notch service from, especially when being an owner member. The staff did try their best to accommodate us to the best of their ability but we still feel a bit slated in that we didn't get the full feel of the family vacation that we expected to get. Hopefully next time this doesn't happen. I guess check and make sure there aren't any sports team events going on when you plan a vacation!!</td></tr>

Breakfast offered a decent buffet at a decent price, beach time was lovely. Late checkout only extended our time by an hour so we asked if there were shower facilities that would allow us to spend time at the pool before we left. The shower we found is ONE shower in a unisex combined bathroom within the indoor pool area. I ended up walking through the hallways with only a towel to find so where I could get dressed after I briefly showered in this bathroom that would make a homeless shelter look sanitary. The main restroom near reception had three? doors locked. Apparently regular and thorough maintenance of the restrooms can't be handled? 20 minute elevator waits too. Terrible planning and staff planning. We left and went elsewhere to spend quite a bit for lunch because my husband was so fed up. Such a busy place, I was surprised that the entire inside dining wasn't available until 4:30 . Proper staffing and using common sense could have brought more money into the hotel and certainly would have provided a better experience for us.</td></tr>

Since I was tired, I tried to ignore it and go back to sleep. A few minutes later, there is another demanding knock on the door. When I open the door, it is the cleaning person, asking when I will check out. Now, 8:30 is in no way close to the checkout time, and I was not delaying her job by trying to get my rest. So my response is that I don't know when I will be checking out. She then demands an estimate of when I think I will be checking out. After a late night this was the last thing I wanted to deal with at 8:30 in the morning. After that encounter I begin to get ready for the day, since I was alerady awake. After about 20 minutes out of bed, I see a huge bug crawling where I had just slept. Not my idea of a friendly or clean hotel, and I will not be visiting any time in the near future.</td></tr>

Being an BPG gold member & owners of 2 villas in the USVI,we made a fabulous choice & will stay here again (and are looking forward to it!). We had to stay close to home and chose the AC Sheration (and glad we did). It's clean,cheery and is sure to satisfty you. As for the parking,it's well worth the small fee considering that you're in AC & parking is at a premium everywhere in the city. We stayed club level (what an added treat),& staff throughout the whole hotel treated us excellently (as well as superb BPG recognition). As far as the pool goes,yes,it is small & needs a little more attention,but if staying here in the summer,you have the whole Atlantic ocean at your doorstep!

There are so many outstanding features at the Dolphin. The choice of pools is amazing. It doesn't matter what age you are the Dolphin has the perfect pool for you. Small children? Zero entry and a slide. Teens? lap pool and lounge pool. Adults? Bring me a mai tai please, I'm sun bathing! For food you can go economy and stock your cubby with bread peanut butter and milk, you can eat very reasonably at the Fountain or Buffeteria or you can live it up at one of the fine steak or italian restaurants on site. Our maid service was fantastic. Though you can choose to skip the maid service for BPG points. Personally I love returning to a fresh room! For those who say it lacks the "Disney" feel i disagree. On our last morning we walked to the early morning entry for epcot, road Soaring and Mission Space, took the boat over to Hollywood Studios for their opening, returned to the hotel for an afternoon of lounging and relaxation at the pool and capped off the evening by walking to epcot for supper, enjoying illuminations and then taking the monorail to magic kingdom for the extra magic hours.

I called the hotel day of arrival at 8pm to confirm bedtype and notified them that we are arriving after midnight since we were driving from San Francisco. When we checked in at 1:45am, John the night manager said that we have a reservation for a King bed, I said no, we reserved a room with 2 beds and told him that I called earlier today to ensure this is in place. I showed him my confirmation indicating 2 double beds. The only thing he could say is that they are sold out and he cant do anything. Obviously they gave away my room to someone else and my family and I were inconvenienced especially arriving so late. Everyone was tired from the trip, and we had to wait for a rollaway to be sent up to the room. There were only 2 bath towels in the bathroom. My husband and I had to squeeze in a King bed with one of our kids. The thing that was most disturbing to me was there was NO empathy given by the night manager, no emotions whatsoever, and he was absolutely not sorry that this happend. He did not give a sincere apology and did not offer any solutions. He said that he would move us to a room with 2 beds the next day. Well this is just another inconvenience for us. The next day when we called the front desk to get an update on the room move, the agent did not even offer assistance to move our luggage to the new room, instead they just sent the keys up and we had to move our own luggage. This hotel does not understand what customer service is. There was no service promise whatsoever. Very dissappointed!</td></tr>

The cleaning staff came to our room while we were at Hershey, turned off our air, left the damp sheets on the bed and left a dirty cleaning rag on the bed which I later brought to the front desk. We were given breakfast buffet the next morning on the hotel, which was nice, but a dirty room is a dirty room. I don't think we will come back.</td></tr>

I didn't realize it until I got home later that evening. You can imagine my anxiousness. I immediately called the hotel and was transferred to loss prevention. I spoke to Joseph and to my surprise he told me it had been turned in by housekeeper Rachel. I couldn't believe it! He told me to call his boss, Jimmy, the next morning to make arrangements for its return. When I spoke to Jimmy the next morning he was so gracious and told me how things like this were normally handled. He shipped it overnight to my home and I received it the next morning. I can not thank everyone involved enough, especially Rachel. Her honesty and integrity is something I don't see very often in my line of work! I have told this story to many of my friends and co-workers and everyone has the same shocked look on their face as I did when Joseph told me he had my I-pad. Please except my sincere thanks to everyone involved. I hope to come back soon and thank them all in person.</td></tr>

Overall though the staff was great, room was very nice, bed was super comfortable, room stayed cool and was quiet.

We were coming in from Las Vegas and I knew we were going to be late so I called ahead to make sure they knew we would be arriving late. We arrived around 2am and checked in at the Bay Tower. Juan at the front desk was very rude and told us that we would have to stay in the other tower (Marina Tower). We drove back over to the other tower and found our rooms after walking to the opposite side of the tower, outside and down some stairs. The rooms were filthy and extremely small. I would not have paid $50 to stay in these rooms called the 'Lanai Tower'. The doors were facing an open outdoor style hallway facing a dirty rundown parking lot with no type of security. Juan at the front desk did not even bother to give us any details about this room. We had 3 adults and 4 children and the rooms were too small to accommodate everyone as I specifically requested some roll away beds which were not available in this location. I tried to explain to the desk clerk that these were definitely not the rooms I reserved and they were unable to accommodate our needs. She did not seem to understand me and kept saying they had no availability and the rooms in the Bay Tower were EXACTLY the same. I do not understand how I could have a reservation and not be able to check in to the rooms I reserved. We ended up staying the night in these rooms and being moved the next day to the rooms I originally reserved. The rooms in the Bay Tower were much nicer, cleaner and larger so the fact that we kept being told they were the same is not true. I was upset over this entire experience and will not be staying here again. Also, if you are military or veteran, stay away! We paid for the rooms using military vouchers and I suspect that is why our rooms were downgraded! NOTE: We were comped breakfast and parking (both very overpriced!) after a long argument with the desk clerk at 2AM!</td></tr>

At check in we found that not to be the case and finding a King Suite was a challenge. The check-in staff was supposed to inform us of a Spa gift cert. that our children had provided for us. It was not. The fruit tray sent to our room with sparkling water bottles had no opener to open the bottles. No kleenex in the room. Housekeeping did not restock water bottles and lotion the 2nd morning. Our room AC was so loud we could not hear conversation, tv, or even the trains outside! And finally - to the decorator - the bed post of the lovely King bed is right in the middle of the tv screen when watching tv from the bed. To end on a positive note - Valet was outstanding!

The only negative experience I had at the hotel was the fact that it took forever for guest services to answer their phone when I called at around 5 a.m. in the morning since I had an issue with the internet connection.

The rooms were very clean, however, instead of replacing the plastic cups in the bathroom, they rinsed one of them out and placed it back on the counter - that was bizzare. We also had an issue with Wi-Fi service, but once we reported the problem it was taken care of ASAP. Great customer service!! One last thing, I like the idea of if you choose not to use house-cleaning for a day, you can earn 500 BPG award points. That's great for folks that spend minimal time in their room. We enjoyed our stay and will continue to stay at Grandbourne properties whenever possible.</td></tr>

And this was offered only after my wife and I pressured the staff for some kind of compensation. Second, I booked a suite expecting to be amazed but only came to discover the room was very average at best. The room was small with no barrier between the living room area and master bed. It was as though the hotel took an oversized room and crammed as much furniture into it as possible. Third, the balcony view was very nice but, again, for a suite, of which there are only eight of in the entire hotel, you would think the balcony would stand out from an average room, nope. It was small and only big enough to fit two pieces of stock lawn furniture and a table the size of a small pizza. Unfortunately, we won't be staying here again.</td></tr>

There was no special consideration for BPG members. There was no local free parking. There was only self park ($12) or valet ($20). The valet service was the only bright spot of this whole stay. There was no concierge/club level lounge available, which I found hard to believe from a large, downtown hotel. Breakfast buffet for two was $35 and the quality and service were in line with a $3.50 buffet for two. I had received a $25 BPG gift reward that was not honored. The next night we stayed at a Belvoir in Charlotte where all these negatives were reversed which helped restore my faith in the chain.

The staff were mainly very helpful, although there was limited local knowledge about Chesapeake beaches and i was told to go and "look on the internet". I was hoping for a more proactive and helpful approach from someone who clearly lives within an hour of the sea. We didn't eat here and chose to shop locally for our breakfasts. Limited wine selection in the bar was disappointing.There is a great free shuttle service to King Street and the airport, and the Metro into DC is walkable and very handy. Parking is expensive. If you just go for a room, it's worth it. If you add on all the extras it can be pricey.</td></tr>

Because of how bad this service was and how sick the member of my family was we checkout of the hotel and went over to another Disney resort hotel and checked in for one night there. If I was granted a late check out that is normally offered to PLATINUM members I would have inquired with the front desk about extending my stay one more night if they had the availability.

It was the fact that the hotel manager actually got up on stage and welcomed us to the hotel.

As a Lifetime Platinum guest, I have become used to spending no more than five minutes at the reception desk and then I am off to continue my very busy schedule. In this case, I stood at the counter for over one and one half hours, trying to get these four rooms set for my staff's arrival later in the day...to say that I was beginning to get a bit cranky, would be an understatement. Enter the ProActive Front Office Director. In my 700 plus stays with Grandbourne, I would be correct to say that I have had similar occurrences...with one significant difference...This astute gentleman was not there...fortunately, he was in attendance here. There is something about this outstanding individuals demeanor that emphasizes his sincere apology...individuals can say "I'm sorry" all day long and you have a sense that they don't really mean it. This Front Office Manager is a very self-assured gentleman. He also demonstrates a sincere concern...empathy...for what his guests are dealing with. He was able to resolve the situation within a matter of a couple of minutes and I was on my way. I ran into him in other locations on the property throughout the stay and he was most gracious, asking how my stay was going and offering to do whatever was necessary to provide a positive experience on the property. This young man clearly understands interpersonal relationshipshe gets it! He understands hospitality and the associated responsibility of providing within Grandbourne guidelines, all that Grandbourne promises and then some to each of his guests. In my global travels of the past 40 years, I can say without reservation that this individual represents the very best qualities for success in your business, both professionally and personally...you are incredibly fortunate to have him in your employ.</td></tr>

The toilet sounded like it was constantly filling and we had to call down about it. The vending machine on our floor ate our money, the one on the next floor was broken and the one two floors down that did work served us a warm bottle of water. There were also gnats in the bathroom, many of which were deceased and stuck to the ceiling because of the moisture that built up due to the lack of a fan. We ordered coffee, fruit and cereal for breakfast, which was fine. However, we were also brought butter, jam, syrup and ketchup on our tray, which was just weird.

When entering the room it appeared as though the room was cleaned yet not put back together; drawers not pushed in, table pushed to the side, etc. I was looking for local information and called the front desk, the phone rang no less then 20 times, NO Answer. I called back on the guest services line, the phone rang 4 times, was picked up and hung up. I walked down to the front desk and asked where the guest services line would be ringing to, and the asst. manager said here. The tall guy working behind the desk looked over, said he was busy at the time i called; so, one does not answer the phone, or picks up the phone and hangs up. I am not sure why the hotel appears to be run down with the business that it does at that location; i would hope that changes are slated for the near term.</td></tr>

The restaurant was delicious and there was the same attention to detail. Water glasses were kept filled and the staff was very attentive. An added plus was the fact that much of the food served was grown in the garden of the farm on the same property of the complex. I stayed 2 nights and enjoyed the entire stay. I also attended a conference at the conference center. Assuming this is part of the hotel I will include my praise. The latest high tech equipment is in each board room. The bathroom was huge, beautiful, and spotless! The live plants were a nice touch. There was always ice cold water(with lemon), coffee, tea, or soda available. I can't say enough as I was truely impressed!</td></tr>

Staff is very friendly and helpful.</td><td>1</td><td>Satisfied customer</td><td>My stay at the Belvoir was 8/19/12 through 8/24/12. The hotel entrance is on a very narrow one way street. Upon my arrival, there was a limo blocking part of the street where guests could park their car to check-in. Since I didnt think there was a place to park, I drove around the block and found a parking lot to park my car while I walked to the hotel to check-in and inquire about the parking. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Belvoir doesnt have any parking, but they recommended a lot one street over. You can have valet service parking which is $39 a day w/ in and out privileges or you can walk over and pick up car on your own for $25 a day which I chose to do. Now on your first day at the hotel, they will have someone drive your car to the lot without being charged the valet cost. However, you will have to pick your car up on day of departure if you dont want to pay $39 a day. Not a big deal since lot is a short walking distance, but it is in a sketchy area. The best thing to do is not have a car to park. There is plenty of public transportation. Buy an MTA card with unlimited usage, depending on your stay, and you can take the bus or subway all day long. I bought a 7-day card for $29 and never had to use my car. Anyway, back to the hotel. Its very nice. The room was very clean with white linens. Bed and pillows were very comfy. I had a room with two double beds. There was an armoire sized closet to hang clothes, but no drawers. There is a safe for money or jewelry. Easy to use with a swipe of a credit card instead of having to remember a code. There is a large desk and chair if you need to work. I didnt because I was on vacation, yay! There is a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee available. Water was provided for a charge. Not sure if coffee was free or not since Im not a coffee drinker. The 42 TV was nice, although the cable connection needs fixing. Short breaks in programs every now and then causing missed dialogue. Maybe wifi has something to do with it, which is free in the lobby. The view from my room was horrible. Looked at a construction site with large crane lovely. Didnt really bother me though because the location of the crane was actually helpful when trying to get my sense of direction outside the hotel. I could just look up and find the crane and know where hotel was. The hotel has a small pool, hot tub, and sunning area on the second floor. The second floor also has a work out area that can be accessed with your room key, which is really a card. (who uses keys anymore, right?) Also, youll need keycard to use elevator to go to your room. Pain in the pants, but good security measure. Another feature to your room, you can earn $5 coupon if you dont have maid service every day. Keepin it green gets you $5 off at their restaurant. Grubsteak is the hotel restaurant. Had breakfast there one morning with coupon in hand. No other customers were in the restaurant probably because it was like a freezer in there. The thermostat had to be set at 600, so much for going green. Brrrrr. I like it cold, but that was too cold. I think it probably drove a few customers away while I was there too. Now, about the surrounding area. During the day, theres plenty of hustle and bustle. No need to feel afraid to roam the streets. Juniors restaurant is very close. Juniors is a diner thats famous for their cheesecake. There are also plenty of pizza shops to buy a slice of pie. To go downtown Manhattan, the Jay St. subway station is just a couple streets over from the hotel. Brooklyn Heights is a very nice area that you can get to on foot. To get into eastern part of Brooklyn, walk to Myrtle Ave. and take the B54 into Ridgewood. This is during the day. At night, you have to be more cautious. The area is dark and deserted. Keep in mind when returning to your hotel. The area is in transition with lots of construction going on. The price of this hotel is much cheaper than in Manhattan and quality of hotel is probably better, as well. I enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to stay here again.</td></tr>

No indication which of two sets of entry doors lead you to the front desk.

There was NO extra bedding for the fold out bed. You would expect they if it took 2 EXTRA hours to clean it, the room would have been ready, and equipped for the number of guests on the reservation. (Also, I was surprised that a suite has no coffee maker). The next morning, the housekeeper knocked on the door at 9:30am, and wanted to CLEAN, REALLY?? a late check in and an early check out?

After being shuffled around and continuously on hold with the hotel and Reservations, i finally was informed that i could not cancel nor reschedule my visit unless there was a mandatory visitor evacuation of Key West. After reviewing information from the National Hurricane Center (coupled with my 30 years of living in South Florida), i realized that it was highly likely that a visitor evacation would occur sometime during my stay. Numerous times i was told by the Belvoir's resident meteriologists that this would never happen. I told them what a predicament this left me in being unable to cancel or reschedule. I would have to begin my travels on friday morning, a 4 hour+ drive from Fort Lauderdale (our friends from Baltimore were traveling a much greater distance to reach us first of course). If an evacuation was ordered while driving down i would have to turn around. If it occurred after i got there, it could be an 8 hour drive for nothing. But instead of offering me to reschedule or cancel so that i could go to another Belvoir in say Orlando, Holly at the front desk told me that's why people get Travel Insurance. So given my predicament and the condescending attitudes, it was either travel 4+ hours on friday with the hopes of being able to stay more than 24 hours or sacrifice 24,000 points and several hundred dollars on the 2nd suite i also reserved (trying my best to not be specific).</td></tr>

The room was spacious; had an electrical plug in close to the bed for my "crackberry"; had an amazing view of Navy Pier; and was very quiet the entire stay.

Second, you charge for parking, which might be understandable though free parking could be appreciated. However, I was surprised to find myself driving around at 11PM looking for a parking spot. A lot of parking space is blocked for valet parking. To me, this is unacceptable because I paid for it.</td></tr>

I travel frequently and have never received such a cold impersonal treatment. A little polishing up and improvement in their public relations skills would not be a bad idea. Furthermore,the inconvenience of having a non functional ice machine on the Club floor where I was staying and having to run down to the fourth floor every time I needed ice did not contribute at making my stay very comfortable. Another feature which I think should be part of the rooms is a personal safe. The parking situation was totally catastrophic friday and saturday night.We were obliged to have to park in the parking lot of the neighboring hotel.</td></tr>

There was a gamer tournament in the hotel and it was quite noisy and trash was strewn about the common areas. I could get past this. What disturbed me, however, was there was no toilet paper in my room when I checked in and it took over an hour and a second call for someone to respond. Likewise, I never got my voucher for "going green" and declining housekeeping. However, someone came in to clean but stopped halfway through -- the soap, shampoo, conditioner, and other amenities were thrown into the trash can that was left on the bathroom counter but not replaced and thebath mat and towels I'd hung to dry were removed and not replaced so I had none of those items available for my shower. Fortunately, the shower gel remained and I was able to dry off with the hand towels before checking out. Based on the length of time I had to wait for a response to the prior evening's request, I didn't bother to call down for replacement items. I had a plane to catch and did not want to be late.</td></tr>

The grounds are beautiful and we took a dip in the pool, relaxed in a hammock and explored the different excursions offered on the water! The staff was friendly and helpful.. Parking was easy and available and we were a quick 10 minute drive to downtown. if you need a last minute deal or place to crash for the night, this is a great option!

We were in a conference room for a wedding and there was still food on the floor - looked like nobody had vacuumed and we had a crawling baby who we had to watch closely because of these food particles. My brother in law was in the rest room and a Belvoir employee was in there on the phone. When he went to wash his hands the Belvoir employee said something to the extend of "can you keep it down, I'm on the phone". My brother in law said "excuse me" and the employee walked out. I thought that was TERRIBLE and he should have reported it to the hotel manager. We got an event discount but I would NEVER pay full price for this hotel. We paid $150/night and that was even pushing it. The only good thing was the location - so close to every thing we had going on that weekend.

Apparently the house keeping staff can get away with not changing the beddings for the pull out couch until you decide to use it for a "good" night sleep. I'm greatly disappointed with my stay at Belvoir Columbus suites, I had stayed there at [YEAR-4] during the labor day weekend and that's why I returned. I am definitely not going back there again the conditions are deplorable and the hotel quality standards have declined over the last four years. I'm also disappointed with the toll free customer service line which could not elaborate on whether we were enrolled to stay using redeemed points or credit transactions. After my disappointment while staying at Belvoir Columbus suites I was further aggravated with a credit card deduction rather than my points being redeemed. The issue was never resolved and I was flipped back and forth between customer service and the hotel staff and "appeased" with courtesy points. Apparently the hotel was not willing to refund my credit card charges and exchange them with the abundant points I have with my BPG membership</td></tr>

When we would walk in the halls they would talk in their foreign language and giggle, obviously talking about us. I would have given this Hotel 5 star if it werent for the rude housekeeping staff.</td></tr>

Unfortunately it didn't meet the standards of others in the chain. As soon as I walked in I noticed my room smelled of sour mildew. I called down before ever unpacking to let them know and request a room change. I was told that it was probably my sheets (why would it be my sheets?) and that she would send someone up to change my linens. Reluctantly I went out for dinner only to find upon my return that noone had been to the room. It was rather late and having had a long day I decided to deal with the issue the next morning. The matter was worsened when I found that the bath towels had an even stronger mildew smell, especially when wet. It was so strong that I felt it was leaving the same odor on my skin. My complaints came with a response that someone would come replace my linens. My sheets were replaced the next day while I was out at meetings but the nicely folded, clean looking towels again were horrific smelling when wet. To top all this off, the ice machine on my floor did not work. Although this would have only been a minor complaint, considering my disgust with the room this only added to my overall dissatisfaction with this hotel.</td></tr>

They didn't have mini fridges in their rooms, which was a minus, and I hit the bed frame that was sticking out 3 times, resulting in a bad bruise on my ankle.

When we finally got to our room it had no mini fridge, which okay, that's fine. But no full length mirror either. Just a little annoying. The walls of the room were paper thin. We heard everything from door opening and closing, slamming, the ice machine, other peoples conversations in the hallways, and most importantly we could hear full conversations in the room next to us. Not only could we hear their conversations but we could hear all kinds of innapropriate adult noises. Not to mention our bed was shaking thru the walls! If that's not enough the room never cooled off to reach our requested 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The only plus was that we could change the fan to continuous which helped blocked out SOME of the noises. We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary, so we kept our spirits high and tried to use this awkard situation to the best we could. Next time we stay down town OKC we will definitely stay elsewhere in the city. Too bad because we had such great expectations.</td></tr>

We thought the shuttle was there to pick us up, but it was picking up a dozen attendents from the airline. They did let us on the shuttle, but made it clear that they were contracted to pick up the attendants, who had not been waiting at all. We were not impressed with the pick up that night. It felt like only the airline attendants were important and they didn't care when we got picked up at all. In talking to the hotel staff on duty, they seemed to re-iterate that the attendants were contracted and we had to just wait for a shuttle to come along and maybe it would be longer than 30 minutes. That is a long time to wait when the hotel is less than 5 minutes from the airport.</td></tr>

I had made reservations in JAN for this hotel. Upon checking in I was told that they did not have a double bed room that I reserved that they only had a king bed with a chaise; so started my horrible experience. I told the girl that would not do and she went and got her manager Kenny. Kenny and basically says the same thing and I ask HOW if I reserved a room 6 months ago and you not have it. He told me he could try and explain it but it didnt matter because they didnt have it. He said it with such attitude and condensation that caused me to get angrier at this situation. He then tried to blame it on the dance convention we were attending and I told him that wasnt going to work since it was Belvoir I had booked with. He told me it would be the next day before they would have a room with a double bed and that I would need to contact them in the morning and be in my room so they could get us moved over. We took the room they had and I left to join the group. Upon talking to another mom in my group she was told they didnt have a room ready but that the housekeeping staff was behind and it would be ready soon and they offered her $50 off per night she was there. She and I went back to the desk so someone could tell me why I was told something different and why nothing was offered to me as a discount. Spoke with Kenny AGAIN and got the same answer with the same attitude that the other mothers witnessed as well. Lucky for me another mom in our group said that the room we got would be better for them and we were able to switch, NOTE I FIXED THE ISSUE NOT Belvoir!!!!!! The following say I called down to find out the status of the fridge we had requested since as well that had not been received. I had been told the night before that there was a waiting list and I should get one soon. Of course when I called down and spoke to an agent who got me manager on duty Luke he didnt have me on the waiting list. He and I spoke at length about the previous night and how I fixed the problem myself and he told me they would allow me to keep my credit of $50/ per night. I laughed ALLOW ME that wasnt even a question anymore. He told me he would call me back in 15 minutes about the refrigerator. He did and told me it would be brought to our room in 15 minutes. 45 minutes later I call back down and get someone in guest services I asked to speak to Luke she asked if she could help and I said no I need to speak to Luke, She transferred me and I got his voicemail. I called back got the same lady and she gave me her manager who got on the phone and was yelling (the other mother with us in the room could hear her across the room) at me about how Luke shouldnt have promised me anything. I said he did and she said well she would just get me the General Manager Finally I thought No, I got his VM so I called back to ask to have him paged or something and I again got the same guest services lady who told me, Ms we cannot just get him out of a meeting to talk to you I will leave a message with his secretary and she HUNG UP ON ME!!!! I grabbed me hotel key and set off to find the manager myself I was directed to the 4th floor and got to talk to him face to face.. He apologized and spoke very frank which I appreciated and I thought things were solved. We enjoyed the rest of our trip, got my bill before we left and saw that they would credit me and home we came Its now 2 months later and I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT ON MY BILL!!! GO FIGURE I would not recommend this hotel at all.</td></tr>

Room did not have adequate towels, room service had to be contacted twice before anyone brought more towels. Bathtub did not drain (at all) after showering, I was standing in 3 or 4 inches of water.

In a way I don't blame the housekeeping staff, the bathroom is tiny and hard to get in unless you step right between the toilet and the tub.

Each time it proves to be one of the best experiences of our Disney vacation. Cocktails at the lobby bar are top notch and always quick to relax at the indoor fountains. There are GREAT restaurants, our favorite is Kimonos Sushi Bar-- never disappoints. They even have Karaoke late nite. The boat service is free and runs to The Boardwalk-- where you can buy food, pizza, and there are restaurants including ESPN and a Dancehall. More importantly the boats run to Disney Hollywood Studios and Epcot-- which is always a fun way to arrive. And as a Disney hotel you get free early/late access to the parks. Free buses to all the other Disney Parks. The Mandara Spa is always a relaxing experience-- with specials often available. The Pool is huge (there are actually several pools) has a waterslide, and at least 3 Whirlpools/Hot Tubs. The Cabanas Bar offers great poolside drinks and snacks. Check out the basement restaurant which also has sundries like candy, snacks, sandwiches and dinner specials you can take to go -- cheaper than room service. Usually a bit higher priced than other BPG hotels in Orlando, but it's WORTH IT-- the convenience, the location, the pool, the restaurants, and the DISNEY DAILY EXTRA ACCESS to Early Park Entry and Late Park Stays.</td></tr>
