The pool was so cold you couldn't even get in and it was dirty too! This AFTER we waited over an hour for the maintenance guy to fix the door so we could actually get into the pool area. I had to call the front desk twice to get that done!! The bathtub in the room had stains that I could not remove after trying to clean it myself. For what we paid for this room for one night, they did not even offer a continental breakfast yet the rude front desk guy informed me I could purchase breakfast (for a ridiculous price per person) in the hotel restaurant. We were already paying above what was reasonable for that level of quality and to not offer breakfast is ridiculous!!! The room has two air vents in the ENTIRE room and the air goes on and off which is very frustrating...the room remained hot and never felt comfortable (yet the air was working properly) no matter how low we turn it down. The guy at the front desk was on a personal call when I walked up one time to ask a question and actually rolled his eyes and stated ""what do you need?!"" Ummm...this was the worst experience we have ever had a hotel and considering the cost of the whole thing I would NEVER stay here again!! We checked out other hotels in the area (due to having to return to the area in a couple months) and would stay at those over this hotel in a heartbeat!!! This hotels offer either continental breakfasts or breakfast buffets at their restaurants at a way lower price than this place, Take my advice....BOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"

My most recent stay was a terrible exception. The hotel is under renovation and the staff clearly was not prepared to handle the problems renovations can bring. The day I was there, some sort of housekeeping problem prevented rooms from being ready at check in. The staff did not handle the situation well at all. I was repeatedly told my room would be ready in an hour and when I returned to the registration desk, I would stand in line for 20-30 minutes with other angry guests only to be told it would be another hour. I watched while one guest after another left the registration desk in frustration. What added to the frustration was the nonchalant attitude the staff seemed to have. They seemed completely unconcerned that guests could not get into their rooms even though check in time had long passed. I finally had to leave for a 7:00 dinner reservation and on the way to the restaurant I received a call indicating my rooms were ready. I had specifically reserved 2 rooms with 2 beds each and asked them to be sure to hold those as I had 5 people in my party, including adults who did not want to share a bed. By the time we returned from dinner they had given one of the rooms away and only had a king room available. After a conversation with the manager and several trips to various rooms (none of which had 2 beds), I finally gave up and took a king room. By this time it was 10:30 PM. The manager was apologetic, but clearly unequipped to address the situation. He offered no compensation, so I took it upon myself to suggest that he comp one of the rooms. He agreed to do so, but the fact that I had to ask after having arrived at the hotel at 2:30 and not getting into my room (and the wrong one at that) until 10:30 PM was ridiculous. Grandbourne typically provides a high level of customer service. This was not the case at all the Belvoir New Orleans. I would not recommend staying here until all the renovations are complete."

One issue I had was with parking, both my sister and I, as well as another guest we met up with, were under the impression that parking and the shuttle service were free. These important deals were part of the reason we chose this hotel. Much to our dismay, we arrived at the hotel and realized that we had somehow been mistaken, and while the shuttle service to Disneyland was free, parking was not. Not only was parking not free, it was $14 per night! I find this price completely unacceptable. Also, you have to take a ticket when entering that parking lot, but instead of being charged based on this ticket, the parking is charged to your room based on the number of nights you've booked. Because of this, when you leave the parking lot the gate is open and you do not have to turn your ticket in. My issue with this is that any person that is not a guest at the hotel could drive in, take a ticket, park, and then drive out for free since the gate it always open. While they can park for free, I have to pay $14 because I'm STAYING at the hotel? This, to me, is not alright. My other issue was that they took $100 out of my account without any notice at all. I understand that any hotel is going to want to have a credit card on file in case of any incidents, this is pretty standard. Which is why when I arrived at the Belvoir Anaheim and they asked for my card, I was not surprised at all. Since we had paid for our two night stay in advance, I did not expect to see any additional charges on my card. Much to my surprise, when I checked my account later that day, $100 had been taken from my account. When we returned to the hotel that evening, I asked someone at the front desk about the charge and they explained that it was for any incidents and would be returned to my account after our checkout as long as there were no damages or additional charges to the room. I can understand why they do this, my issue is that no one told me about this charge when I checked in, nor was I warned about this charge when I booked the room or in my confirmation... and yes, I did go back and check it. I just think that someone could really be in trouble if they are not planning on an additional $100 coming out of their account, and therefore the staff needs to be sure to inform the guests of this charge. Even better, the guest should be told before booking the hotel that this charge will be taken out at time of checkin. My last issue was that our toilet in our room was difficult to use. We had to flush 2-4 times every time it was used in order to get everything to go down. We decided that we could live with this, so I did not inform staff until we went to the front desk to checkout. When I informed the assistant manager that was checking us out, he only said ""ok"" and did not thank us or apologize for the broken toilet. He did not seem to be concerned with it at all. Other than the parking, $100 charge, and toilet, I would recommend this hotel. It it beautiful, comfortable, clean, and is the perfect distance from the park."

The trade show I was attending took place largely in the ballroom, so I needed to gain access to the locked wifi in that area of the hotel.

I patiently waited in the registration line for twenty minutes, and when I finally was able to speak with someone, he stated that I couldn't gain access to the wifi (despite my offer to pay an additional fee) because the trade show organizers hadn't purchased it. He suggested I speak with the hotel's event coordinator - however that person wouldn't be back in the office until after the trade show was over.

Even staying in the presidential suite did not entice the staff to treat my guests and I with any more class/courtesy. The manager, Natasha, did try to redeem the situation, which I appreciate. However, I will never stay there again."

I then wrote BPG and they said no, when status is updated it automatically updates all reservations. In the meantime I attained Platinum and ALL of my reservations were automatically updated. The staff at the hotel were horrible, other than valet service. Housekeeping, or lack of, was not good. Never replaced all of the towels, never received any soap and had to get from front desk every morning. Room was never vacuumed."

I watched the security guard walk to the pool railing, turn around and walk back WITHOUT speaking to anyone. 30 min later the girls quieted down. 5th: I didn't have a receipt under my door as with previous stays, so I went to the front desk to get one. The woman tried her password several times and then said the computer was down and she couldn't print one. (I'm not really buying that) She said she would e-mail one to me before lunch but never did. I had to call the manager the next day to get one. NOT HAPPY! Won't stay again."

The waiter made a point to not stop at our table, and then we watched him see 3 new tables and he even went as far as to take different routes to the back of house.

Overall we enjoyed our stay but there were constant gaps in processes and communications that made our stay a bit irritating and caused extra work on our part. In addition, i shared this review with customer service, but unsurprisingly, did not get a response back. 1. It took 3 calls to the service desk and 2 days for the extra shampoo to be delivered to our room 2. We opted out for the "" green"" option one of the days. The next day we needed to get our room cleaned and did not post the ""green"" door sign. Instead, we got the 5 dollar certificate under the door. Realizing the confusion, we promptly returned the certificate to the front desk and specifically asked for the room to be cleaned. We came back at 10 at night to a dirty room. When called the front desk, the cleaning personnel were unwilling to clean the room at first, then agreed, causing us to sit outside till about 11 PM waiting.  3. I lost my sunglasses at the pool. When calling Lost and Found through the Front desk services, I had to make a new claim each day I called to check on the status. Every time I called, there was no record of my previous inquiry. I had to tell the entire story 3 days. Last day of our stay, it  sounded like someone actually recorded it, but I can not be sure since that was my last daily follow up.  4. Last night of our stay, I ordered a glass of milk to the room. The hotel charged 3 dollar delivery fee and 20% tax summing up to a modest charge of 10 dollars. Not including two call backs asking to specify the milk I wanted.  5. Finally, the bill arrived at the check out charging us for the room again, though the room was paid for in the beginning of the trip. We had to go to the front desk to dispute the charges. Luckily, all was straightened out within minutes, but it would be nice to avoid that experience in the future.  Please take my comments into consideration. That way a hotel this caliber will not appear as inefficient and lacking in service.  Sincerely"

I checked in very late due to going directly from the airport to the hospital to be with her. I called the shuttle to pick me up at the hospital and Sylvester and the driver (John?) were extremely kind and sympathic and did all they could to help with my unique situation. Arriving at the check in desk exhausted and weary from travelling since 5am. the young man checking me in, (Mike? I hate that the names are slipping my mind as they were all so exceptional) did everything possible to make it so that my stay would be as comfortable & stressfree as possible by upgrading me to the Club level so I could take advantage of having a breakfast and snacks/drinks whenever I was not at the ICU. He made sure that I knew who the club attendant was and called ahead to let her know I was coming up and would probably need a snack and a drink (for sure!). I was met with open arms even though Sue was cleaning up the lounge for the night. She made sure I got all that I needed, was warm and genuine. I found this to be true of all the ladies in the lounge-especially Lillian, who took me and my niece under her wing and treated us like family-her kindness and warm heart were apparent from the start. She also works in the ICU so she had met my niece the day before and remembered her from there. I can't say enough about wonderful things about everyone who touched us during this difficult time and went above and beyond-you just don't find that often these days and all gave stellar service. The hotel was lovely and a welcoming, calm sanctuary each night after the chaos of being at the hospital. Luckily, my sister has a good prognoisis and was released-and although a very scary time in our lives, I'll always recall the kindness and caring that was shown to me and my family.

In the past few months have had trouble with keys and had to make more than one trip to the front desk...have had trouble getting internet in the room so could not do work needed to be done...have been put in a handicapped room twice and had to request to be moved. This last check in and issues was handled by a a woman at the front desk who acted as though we were interrupting her day by standing in front of her and breathing! Usually we eat out but when I did ave occasion to eat in the restaurant it was not an enjoyable experience as the staff had to searched for and the food was tasteless. Have in the past requested and recommended this hotel because it is clean and convienent and very quiet considering its proximity to the airport but after the last stay I will now be requesting another hotel.

In general the facilities are fine and there are lots of local activities which I had limited time to experience. From a business travel standpoint the prices throughout the resort and nearby attractions are significantly above what I would typically spend on a business trip. Food prices are high and drink prices at the bar tend to be as high as the high end hotels in downtown San Francisco. If someone else is paying your travel expenses this is a okay destination. Paying my own expenses as I do I found myself looking constantly to go offsite to the surrounding areas to find more reasonable food prices. The daily resort fee and the parking fee really made the per day cost extremely high for business travel. The conference facilities are fine and they met the needs of the group fairly well. Being a grandfather of 7 I could not imagine bringing my grandkids here unless I hit the lottery. With all the other hotel options in the nearby area I'm sure there are more reasonable rates available.

They do not tell you about this ""hidden"" charge before hand; also learned that it takes from 1-10 days for it to be reversed! I also had to wait for 25 minutes on hold.

Do not stay at this hotel, if they advise you that the resort charge is mandatory, for some guests do not pay it.",4,The Resort Charge,"I first stayed at this fine hotel in 1974. Over the years, I have returned frequently. It has been my home, when at Waikiki. The hotel has undergone a number of transformations and refurbishments. This latest incarnation is the best yet. But there is a problem: the so called ""mandatory"" resort charge. I first learned of this after I had made my reservation for this stay. Being advised by an email from the hotel that the charge was mandatory, I accepted this as fact, and when asked at check in if I knew about the charge, I dutifully replied in the affirmative and paid it. But shortly, the disappointment began, followed by outrage. When I went to log in to the ""free"" (a benefit of paying the resort charge) WiFi, the screen informed me that the charge would be $14 per day, but IF I were paying the resort charge, it would be free. ""IF""? This implied that some hotel guests were not paying the resort charge. Then I noticed costs associated with certain activities in the weekly planner booklet given us. But, other documentation advised us that ""IF"" we had paid the resort charge, those activities would be free. So, the next day, in a friendly manner, I started asking some hotel guests I randomly met if they had paid the resort charge. It was in this manner that I learned that some had not. Well, it was obvious at that point, anyway. While the list of ""benefits"" associated with the resort charge is lengthy and interesting, given a proper choice at check in, I would have declined to pay it. The amount was about $125 for our 5 night stay. A better investment would have been 10 Mai Tai's -- 1 for me and 1 for my wife, daily. I did raise this issue at check out, as I was asked if I had any problems during my stay, but of course the response was just a sympathetic smile. Nothing could be done. I have been loyal to the Belvoir Waikiki for nearly 40 years, but I find the imposition of the so-called mandatory resort charge to be deceptive and outrageous. This is no way to treat your loyal customers. It is no way to treat anyone. The next time I travel to Waikiki, I will check to see if your hotel still imposes the resort charge. If it does, I will stay elsewhere. I shall not return until the resort charge is eliminated, and I am advising others headed for Waikiki to do the same. It's a shame really. You have such a fine facility, and such a friendly and competent staff. Yet you have chosen, through management greed, to undermine and negate these strengths through deceptive marketing of a resort charge. If you really need extra income from guests, just build the charge into your rates. I hope to stay with you again some day, but this may have been my last stay. It's up to you. Aloha!"

Upon check out I figured I would complain one last time (let them know how horrible their customer service was) the lady at the counter asked what should she do about it....not apology. Finally the lady next top her said just giver her 2000 star points. Star points what are startpointsand if I am unhappy with your facility and only there on business what makes you think I am going to return tio use my star points. I paid over $500 for my room and was compensated with star points.

Thats why we were stuck in a room right by elevator and it sounded like a party in the hall all night when people came in. Didn't sleep well at all. We were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary so I was disappointed. All the other reviews were great so that made me even more disppointed.

We set out to find a place for something light and found Smokey Bones (open until 2AM). My suggestion is that the front desk staff have a list of restaurants in the area and their hours of operation for those unfortunate times when guest have been delayed and famished upon arrival. Having salads at the gift shop would have solved the problem. Ask not to be put in the corner of the hotel, after a very long day & night, we awoke the next morning to the roaring of HVAC units on the roof just above the corner room we had been assigned.

Upon entering my room it was filthy the bathroom was not cleaned it even had a dirty towel in it yet. I ordered room service which took three seperate tries and being connected multiple times and when the food arrived it was horrible. The next morning I ventured for a cup of coffee which was an adventure as the resturant still had the closed sign and I had to ask three different people for assistance s they did not know why it was not open yet only to find later they forgot to change the sign.

When I went to check my bags while I was waiting for my room the two people at the bell desk sat there and talked about work for five minutes while I waited. I know it was five minutes as by then I was curious to see how inattentive this staff could be so I was looking at my watch. Now I just checked my personal credit card (the one on my profile) and they charged my stay on that card and not the card I presented at check-in although the room was not a prepay.

Only issue is location. It is smack dab in the middle of the ""Chinatown"" of Queens. Most all of the resturaunts in the area did not have menus in English and did not take credit cards.

The good-The location is great, the staff are friendly and we were pleased to see that the rooms have been updated. The bad-the elevators are terrible! They are not traditional in that you don't just push a button at the elevator bank and wait for the first one. These elevators require you to enter your floor number, then it flashes a car number for you to wait for. Sounds easy, and as though it would be more efficient but, it doesn't work out well in reality. I can't tell you how many people I've seen that are confused by this, end up getting frustrated and holding things up. The line to get to the elevator during Mardi Gras is just awful! Don't expect to get up to your room or down to the lobby quickly if it's a busy time. Now, the ugly-our most recent visit was 9/22/12. The hotel is in the process of renovating the lobby so it now feels kind of like an airline terminal that is also under construction (hopefully that will improve!) We had requested an early check in but were delayed in arriving due to convention traffic and didn't arrive till 3 pm. There was a line to check in that wasn't too long but, we were told that our room had not been cleaned yet and so we couldn't check in. I gave them my cell phone number to call when the room was ready and was assured that it would be less than an hour. An hour and a half later we still hadn't gotten a call and had to get back into a much longer check in line where we remained for another 20-30 min. When we finally got to the desk we were told a room was still not available and they didn't know how much longer it would be. There were not enough attendants to check all the guests in and we were not the only ones unable to check in-there were 30-40 people sitting in chairs in the lobby area with their luggage, some curled up on pillows some laying down on the floor- it looked like we were at an airport that had been snowed in, cancelled all flights and passengers were bedding down! We had dinner reservations, we're meeting friends and were looking forward to some time alone without the kids (got the 'romance package' that was supposed to come with chocolates and champagne in the room-never did get those). Spending the few hours we had together in a line sucked.
