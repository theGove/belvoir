The wait staff in the restaurant, however, was abysmal. We waited over 15 minutes to get water when we were the only diners present, then another 15 to order, and another 35 minutes to get our food, during which time we had no staff attention of any sort. Put Ruth in the dining room, is what I say! But otherwise a very nice stay - I would recommend everything but the restaurant.</td></tr>

This time, not so much. Check in time was at 3. I got to the hotel at 3:45 only to be told that my room wasn't ready. No big deal. I asked how long it would take until my room was ready and was told no more than 30 minutes. The girl working at the front desk took my phone number and said they would call when my room was ready. I decided to go for a walk to waste time. I walked a ways and no phone call. After a little while longer, there was still no phone call, so I decided to walk back to the hotel to check and see if my room was ready. It was 4:45 at that time. I had to wait in line to see if my room was ready. It was finally ready but they had never called to let me know. I was sure they were going to at least comp my parking or something but they did not. I didn't want to make a big deal and let it ruin my weekend so I just went up to my room. Everything looked ok except for the greasy hand prints on the sliding glass window. I made the best of my situation because it could have been worse. Fast forward to the next day when I am checking out. I was not told that if you self park, you need your key to get out of the parking lot (so don't use express check out). I used express check out and went to my truck and couldn't get out of the parking lot as there is no attendant in the little booth. So I had to park again and go get another key so I could leave. It took another 20 minutes until I was finally able to leave. When I checked my bank account to see what they charged me for the room, it was almost $100 more than it was before I left and I didn't use any internet or the minibar or anything. I didn't get a receipt emailed to me to let me know what the extra charges were for either. Like I said, I love this hotel but I don't think I will be staying here for a while.</td></tr>

The recently remodeled weight room and lounge were clean, bright and featured state of the art equipment. The pool and beach were cleaned each day. We went as a group to Rustys for dinner.

Room service brought me penne pasta with marinara sauce. For breakfast my over hard eggs were undercooked and instead of herb roasted potatoes I received fruit on a stick. I pointed the mistake out to room service. They stated the system automatically assumes you would like fruit are you sure you want the potatoes? Completely unsatisfactory stay. I will never book a room at this hotel again. When checking out I stated the above issues to customer service and all they could say was sorry to hear that.</td></tr>

The showers were clean, bed was incredibly comfortable, the hotel itself was very Key West. The colors, the vibe were incredibly relaxing. Its away from the hustle and bustle of Duval Street, this place is definetly a place I'll be returning to. Staff was friendly, concierge was great in helping us plan our weekend. They offer shuttle service to the downtown area or to rent scooters, and taxis are literally a minute away ready to go. Overall it was great. I really enjoyed this hotel.</td></tr>

My travel agent called the hotel and made the request to extend. She was informed that the hotel was full but due to my status they would find a way to fit me in. When I checked in, my reservation had not been extended. Furthermore when I told the person checking me in this story, she informed me that I would need to call the BPG desk to be accommodated. When I had my travel agent do that, she was informed that the only way they could get me in was if I paid an extremely ridiculous rate of over $500 for the extra night. And this after we were originally told by the hotel that they would extend my reservation with no crazy rate. Hardly the service that you would expect for a platinum member, or any customer.</td></tr>

The indoor pool was to be heated and it was not. The walls in the room seem like it had been painted to cover something up. The good parts about the stay was the parking was free, the breakfast in the dining room was good. The staff was nice and helpful other than getting me to the club level.

Smoothie done with little fruit and crushed ice. Croissant made from bread dough--nothing delicate about it. Generally AWFUL! And a staff that cared only minimally.

The way the hotel is designed, with the lobby open right up through all the floors making for a very noisy hotel. Lobby noises traveled up to the 7th floor where we staying. If the heater was not running, we heard everything. And not to mention, the inconsiderate guests (not the hotel's fault) next to us - and the very thin walls. We heard them very clearly directly their "dates" to the hotel and later joining them. We called the front desk, but we would have to move.. and we were tired so we just turned the heater on... just a poorly designed hotel, but a beautiful one. If you do stay here, take a portable sound machine to drown out the noises. Now, I have to deal with fixing my hotel bill.. the dinner was supposed to be included in the Valentine's Day package and it was charged to my credit card instead...</td></tr>

The staff was nice. They are upgrading the elevators to a new system I have never seen before and seems very cutting edge. However, my room was nowhere near the elevator shaft, room 3123, and I could hear the elevators constantly. In room menu was very limited and more expensive than I usually see, but the food was good. I would have gone out for food, but needed to work. The carpet in the hallway on my floor was worn through and bunching up- possible trip hazard. We had a 6 hour meeting in a room that apparently backed up to a main street and we could hear cars and trucks throughout the presentations. The biggest issue was that after the first night, my phone in my room did not work and therefore my internet connection would not work. I called and an engineer came to check on it, but all he did was plug/unplug the phones which I had already done. He said someone else would have to repair it the next day so I told him I would be out of the room by 8:30 AM. No one ever came to repair the phones so for a little over 2 days I did not have phone or internet in the room and I had to work from the lobby- others in my group also had phone problems from their rooms. I would not recommend the hotel and unfortunately we have a large customer meeting in the same hotel in June.</td></tr>

Used Starpoints (10,000) for the booking. We checked in at 2:30 P.M. Friday to a very nice room with an ocean view and decided to take a nap before going out to the show. Didn't happen, as construction hammering was going on literally right over our heads and didn't stop, even after a call to the front desk. OK, I understand they need to make improvements, so we went out instead. The Cirque show was wonderful, but believe it or not we were woke up at 8:00 A.M the next morning (Saturday!!) by the same construction banging. SATURDAY MORNING AT 8:00 A.M.--this is completely unacceptable for any hotel, anywhere. We were willing to let the afternoon noise slide, but 8:00 A.M. on the weekend is just ridiculous. We called (twice) and the desk said they would take care of it because the workers weren't supposed to start until 9:00 on Saturday (they let them work Saturday morning when people are sleeping in...???). Noise didn't stop, so we went out to breakfast, then checked out. Spoke to the manager on checking out and she was very apologetic and said she would credit our account back the Starpoints. However, this hasn't happened, so not only were we woke up at 8:00 A.M. on Saturday morning, we were apparently lied to about being compensated for the mess. Too bad, because the people there were overall very nice and friendly; they've just got a terrible problem on their hands with the construction noise. Not sure what floors are affected, but if that's how they treat longtime Grandbourne members....yikes!</td></tr>

I schlepped all our bags both times---no one even thought to offer help. No greeting, no valet. I was thinking, "are they open?". Even after we checked in no one at the desk said...do you need help? We asked for adjoining rooms...no one even looked at the request before our arrival, so we did not get it and had to move after one night. Went to the bar for a cocktail. No martini glasses. Empty resturant, bad food, bad drinks, worse service. Elevator was sooooo slow and then broke down altogether. Dirty. Huge stains on the carpet in all the rooms (and I saw four rooms), poorly constructed, old worn out towels . Did I mention dirty? Right on the freeway so it is so noisy you cannot sleep. Bathrooms are grimy and not correctly built. Shower would not work in one room. I CANNOT believe this is a Grandbourne property. Worst I have ever seen claiming to be Grandbourne. What a dump. Staff has a terrible attitude and are just plain stupid. For example, the clerk told me we had adjoining rooms, we go to the rooms and they are not even near each other ...odd. Went back and was told, "so sorry, we don't guarantee that, but the request was noted." But turns out no one actually looked at the request after we were told on the phone that "it should be no problem." Ordered breakfast so we could get out early to Legoland ...ordered for 8:30-8:45....called at 8:45....obviously had not started it yet.....arrived at 9:20...no apology, no explanation. Sorry, did not do a single thing right from start to finish....Really? A Starrwood? Do not go near this place.</td></tr>

There's strange netting that's hanging off of the side of the building, almost looks like a suicide netting on the corner near the Dos Caminos restaurant. The bathrooms look a little motel-like than hotel, with minimal features. We visited Dos Caminos for breakfast which was fine, and we visited the beach where the attendants for the beach chairs and umbrellas were fantastic. What felt short were the food staff who service the beach. I ordered a drink and a complete meal for two, and after waiting over 30 minutes we asked the new waitress (one we placed our order with was on break or off) for the status of the food order. She came back about 10 minutes later, the food was cold as it was sitting there, and there were no utensils. We again chased down the waitress, and told her there were no utensils with the order. Instead of running to get the utensils for us, she continued to walk around the beach to take drink orders. We then walked up to the beach restaurant, cancelled our order, and left for the day.</td></tr>

But then when the kids went to use the pool it was locked. There were a few people calling down to the desk and waiting. We all had called the hotel to make sure there was a pool to use. This was a big part why we stayed at this hotel. I called the front desk and they told me the pool would be closed until the weekend. Kids were extrememly disappointed.

(probably 60% of the restaurant). there were no clean plates or silverware due to this. the food, once we were able to get a plate and eating utensils was pretty good however. i had a problem with the wifi code and the young man at the desk took care of it for me. we needed a cab on both days to get to the convention center and on sunday when i asked for a cab to be hailed for me the courtesy van driver volunteered to drive us. he was very nice and even pointed out some notable facts about the town as we drove. he even detoured us so we could drive past the kennedy assasination spot. except for one day in the restaurant, i cant say enough good things about the staff at this hotel.</td></tr>
