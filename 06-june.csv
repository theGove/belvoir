Absolutely loved Chicago and will be back soon. However, we will not stay at the Belvoir Hotel & Tower again due to 2 serious flaws. The first and more serious of the 2 flaws was the internet connection speed. The entire stay our connection speed in our room (both wired and wifi) was consistently between 0.3 and 0.4Mbps which is only slightly faster than dialup. If you are a business traveler or somebody that will do more than just check email then you are going to be very frustrated. A hotel of this caliber should have much better internet speed. The second flaw was the TV reception.

My teens loved it! The room was nice and spacious. I was very disappointed to find out that they did not have a club lounge when I arrived. I typically take advantage of this feature and look forward to it each time I travel. This was especially surprising since the welcome email I recieved days prior to my arrival mentioned club advantages. This is false advertising to me and I felt deceived. Also, when I checked in, no one asked to help with my bags nor did they even offer a luggage cart. I was traveling with 3 children, and it was quite a feat to accomplish getting to the room without help. I was also disgusted with the fact that I had to pay for internet. If I could have had club access, this would have not been the case. Parking was not free either, and there was no choice but to park in the garage, which was pretty scary, no security guard, and not well lit at night. This should be complimentary for preferred members. The staff was generally nice and accomodating in the end. After complaining, they provided me with complimentary breakfast in the restaurant for my family each morning of my stay. I would suggest this hotel to others because of the location.

No one went over amenities with me or gave me the Dolphin information sheet, put credit card of other travellers on my room instead of correct room. Do you know you can save $.75 a day if you refuse the USA Today paper, now you know. Did you know that the hotel will give you a $5 food/beverage credit if you refuse housekeeping services per day, well now you know. This is information the front desk failed to provide me upon checkin. They relied on a little plastic card on a table in my room that I read the last day I was there. As well as the fact that my $14 a day resort fee covers 1 hr of local calling if needed as well as the two bottles of water in the room, which they don't deliver until later afternoon.(If you don't get the Dolphin information sheet from the disorganized front desk then you won't know this) The housekeeping staff will hound you as early as 9am to get in the room to clean it if you haven't left for the park and they'll be there at 2pm (during the heat of the day) when you want back in of course. But, hey all of that could have been avoided if the FRONT DESK had done there job and I would have gotten a $5 food and beverage credit to boot! If you go to PIcabu's don't take your kids through the line unless you want to pay $5 per candy item, which is just ridiculous and also you may not have to tip the person bringing your food to the table but don't worry about that beacuse they've got you covered as they add a service charge to your bill, check your receipt. The Bell Hop guy outside when I asked for a cart to bring our luggage looked at me like I had asked for the moon or something since I didn't pull up in the valet area I was treated like I had a disease or something. WOW, I have been to the Disney Resort 15 times now and this was the worst service I have ever gotten. Granted the Dolphin is not an ""Official"" Disney hotel but they still have Disney's name on it and I expected a DIsney quality , ""magical"" vacation experience and this hotel feel really short.

The pool area was filthy on Saturday morning. We were told that someone was to have sprayed/ cleaned down the pool area early in the morning. But whoever came on duty obviously didn't make sure this was done because the same spilled drink and food mess was still there from the day before, there were straws all over, and bird mess all over the chairs and cool deck. Pool service was INCREDIBLY SLOW for both ordering, delivering and pick up (this is bad because the birds and flies are extremely aggressive in attacking left over food). It was surprising how slow considering the pool area was truly not that busy. The pool area was cleaner early Sunday but the garbage was overflowing from the trash bins that had not been emptied from the day before. On both days of our visit there were a lot of dead bugs in the pool, so much so, our children did not want to into one of the pools. In addition, many of the umbrellas are broken with metal arms hanging (my hubby hit is head on one) and the material is flipped up and ripped on many. In this 100 plus degree heat the umbrellas are desperately needed. The staff is AMAZING with the children for activities around the pool and in the club. We had dinner at Koisin and the food is pretty good but a 1/2 hour wait for food is too long with small children waiting to eat. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable but our patio was sticky from something being spilled on it and our friends who travelled with us had soiled duvet cover on their bed. It seems to me a manager should really walk the property as to its pool condition and there should be more staff for service."

In a way of making up for not having a Club Room, gave coupons for breakfast buffet for one and half-off other members tab, but should have really given 2 buffets instead of seeming cheap. Room was great, minus the missing balcony that Executive Suites are advertised as having. I used Suite Upgrade certificates and get a suite without a balcony that is advertised on the hotel's website. Went out to dinner and came back to a full parking lot, except for the valet lot that only had 2 cars in it. Parked in valet instead of having to park out back in the poorly lit construction area. Went in to alert front desk staff and was told I had to ask valet as they are a separate company, desk attendant would not call the valet to the desk or go out to them to ask about leaving my car there, poor customer service for Platinum members. I was offered to park across the street but I could not park in the empty valet lot. Came back on Saturday night and now valet area has moved and the space they had reserved and let stay empty right in front of the entrance on Friday night was now open for guests to park in. Why was this not left open on Friday?? Very poor management. Food on breakfast buffet was pretty bad, no omelette station and soggy waffles instead of fresh made ones. Service was good, but food was really lacking (thank god we only had to pay for half of one buffet otherwise we would have walked out and went somewhere else). In summary, nice room even if not as advertised, nice amenities and pool but very poor customer service and breakfast. Additionally, doors could seal better as they and the ceilings let in a lot of external noise."

We both work 7 days a week and attend grad school and was really hoping to spend some quality time together and visit Universal/Islands of Adventure. When we first arrived, the property looked great. The person at check-in was friendly. The property itself was average and does not offer many activities for people who are not there for a time-share. There was only one restaurant with sub-par food options (stay away from the mushroom pizza). Our room was on the first floor, which was fine but the shower door would get stuck. The shower itself was not clean. I would not bathe in it. There were NO vending machines for snacks and bottled water. There is a tiny ""market"" on the other side of the property which did not offer many options. The staff clearly did not communicate with one another, nor are they fully trained. We asked for a movie rental at the front desk and was told the activity center would have a selection. When we made our way there, the individual working the desk said they never carry dvds and that we would have to go across the property to the market. We were told there was complimentary shuttle service when I called prior to booking the reservation and found after arrival that the free shuttle service was not to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure. We ended up having to cab or ride a shuttle that packed people in beyond the maximum amount allowed legally on a bus. Furthermore, my Fiance left his Kindle in the room upon check-out. I have called 3 days in a room with promises from the staff that someone would call me back. I have yet to hear from anyone. This is the 4th day now.

Upon my arrival at approximately 9 pm the night before I was to speak at the conference, I was told by the front desk that there were ""no rooms available,"" in spite of my guaranteed reservation, and that I was being bumped to another nearby hotel. Despite my protestations, the unsympathetic front desk clerk with a pasted-on fake smile began the process of giving me a voucher to the new hotel only to find out midstream that it had no rooms available either. They sent me to another hotel on the other side of downtown that was dilapidated, filthy and completely substandard. I returned to the Gunter and demanded a better alternative. After 20 minutes of calling, the manager on duty shrugged and said I had no other choice. At which point I called my business travel advisor who said there were plenty of rooms available at the hotel next door (the one they originally planned to send me to). Either the Gunter had no pull with this hotel, or they were unwilling to pay a higher rate--even though I was the one being inconvenienced. To add insult to injury, while I was arguing with the front desk, more than a dozen flight attendants and pilots breezed in (by now it was after 10:30 pm), checked in and were given rooms. Obviously the Belvoir Gunter valued the repeat business of the flight crews over my business, even though I am a senior executive with a national company with over 40,000 employees. The manager on duty the following day told me that this overbooking happens ""frequently"" and that dealing with it is ""his least favorite part of the job."" This hotel seems to have an aggressive overbooking policy, which hurts its customers. To their partial credit, they comped my room the second night with a suite. I was glad they saved my company money the second night, after me having to pay a higher rate to move to the new hotel the first night, but it did little to soothe my extreme exasperation and aggravation from the night before. It was a shame, because the suite and decor was decent when I finally got a room. However, this can't overcome the extremely poor and unprofessional customer service I experienced. I travel regularly and to San Antonio frequently, but this was my first and last stay at the Gunter."

The rooms were beautiful and inviting, the sweet sleeper bed AMAZING!! and the fitness center well I was there every single day for the two weeks thats how great it was -new machines fresh towels, the works. I have to say the best part was knowing that after making arrangements to have the free area shuttle they offer pick me up and drop me off at the office and vice versa everyday for the entire two weeks and to know that every day at the appointed times they were there to take me to the office and pick me up all the time on time!!!

He always asked me how my day was every time I walkeed back into the hotel and after a day of hard work away from home that is definitely superbe service! he deserves a promotion for his incredible customer service skills (I should know I am in travel management myself and If Belvoir did not have him already I would have offered him a job!-Elizabeth in In room dining was another gem! she always made it a point to let me know what the chef specials were everyday and she was always so pleasant.

This forced me to either go out for food or order room service.

Also, I was charged $5.14 for picking up the room phone to make a call in which no one ever answered (not even an answering machine). Please understand, I am no stranger to travel and the expenses involved with high-end hotels. I have stayed in many 4 star hotels in my life but have never experienced such overpricing for things as The Belvoir charged. I easily could've booked a $79-$99/night hotel a few miles away and driven in for my conference and had a much more reasonably priced experience for the money.

That is a little tough with a bunch of sweaty, smelly football uniforms that are needed the next day. The staff did offer to have uniforms cleaned for us, which was nice. They said it is a little expensive, which I was willing to pay BUT we wouldn't get uniforms back until 6 pm the next day when we had a 1:15 game. We had to go find a laundromat. Staff got me an address of one that was closed down. Not very helpful! There were 4 of us in a room with 4 towels. 2 were football players. I had to call 3 times for more towels since the kids showered a few times a day. 2 of the 3 times I waited for at least an hour to get those towels. Once I was told towels were in the dryer. You guys should have been more prepared for this. Also, how can you start the complimentary breakfast at 7 when a few teams had to be at fields at 7? So I wound up paying the extra $20 for complimentary breakfast and didn't get it. I would love to get a refund for that for the 4 days! Also, one day you started the breakfast earlier and ended earlier without notifying guests. Not fair. If you want to make a guest happy, you will credit me (at least) for the ""complimentary"" breakfasts and even a little more of a credit would be nice since I had to drive around and find a laundromat since the one given to me by your staff was closed down.

(really?) Anyway went to the lounge and found out that had no access. Went to the front desk and asked to grant me access. The clerk looked at my record and told me I am not a platinum. Asked her to double check my BPG number she said that my status had expired which I know it did not. Asked them to look up on the file to find my correct BPG number. They said they could not find it. Went back to my room, logged in and made sure my status is still Platinum and got my number. Went back to the front desk they finally updated my record. Gave the key card to the clerk asked her to rekey my access. She said there was no need she already gave me access. So I went up to the lounge only to find out the key still did not work, I went back to the front desk and questioned how could it be so many errors which caused me great inconvenience. The clerks insisted that she gave me access and refuse to go to the lounge with me to verity. Finally my card key was replaced but no explanation or apology."

The best incentive is the appreciation they show to teachers and those in education through their discounted rates. Our group of 21 adults and children all enjoyed our recent visit. This was our 7th stay at this wonderful resort.

Our sever for the evening was Matt C. We found his knowledge of the menu, patience with taking our orders, (we were preoccupied with catching up and not much with our dinner selection) his suggestions and engaging personality made our dining experience a pleasure. Matt provided excellent client service and we wanted to acknowledge that he served us with distinction. Thank you"

We were confirmed (in writing) in a corner room with a lake or river view; however, when we arrived we were assigned a room overlooking the city. We were very disappointed. Also, our valet experience upon checking out was disappointing. The attendant seemed to want to help pack our car, but when I told him how I wanted it packed, he did not comply with my wishes. I had to unpack everything and repack it. Also, our windows were not washed as advertised. I spent a Suite Nights Reward for the upgraded room, which was not what were were confirmed in."

Wireless internet was included in the resort price which is a rare component of most hotel stays. I loved the many restaurants right on site especially Pikabu. However on the last night of my stay I noticed the floor space adjacent to the balcony windows was very damp secondary to rain coming in through during a storm. Also there was a very large cockroach climbing on the wall. I reported these issues to the staff. Overall for the exception of the above, the hotel was great."

The staff was very friendly and willing to assist me with whatever I needed. The rooms were clean. I really liked that TGI Fridays and Starbucks were attached to the hotel.

The room was mediocre and needs to be refurbished. We stayed on the BPG 30th floor with a good view but asides from that, I felt like I walked into a motel 6. The bed looked nice but was uncomfortable. The room was small for the high price listed. Aside from the important part which is the room. The staff was great and the hotel was at a great location. I guess parking around downtown are all ridiculous so all said, you might get a better bang for your buck staying a little outside of the downtown area and take public transportation which is a lot cheaper anyhow."
