This was my third engagement in the area and I looked forward to returning with excitement as the prior two extended stays with this hotel had been wonderful. Management has changed though and I never felt appreciated as a recurring guest. The renovated rooms are lovely, but with restaurants in walking distance in such short supply, the lack of a microwave or refrigerator was a hardship when I am there week after week. Room service never did get it right for me and no attempt was made to encourage my repeat business.</td></tr>

The lounge for Grandbourne patrons was very nice with ample food and flavored water. Why couldn't the staff be as nice as the accomodations?

I was told at check in I was UPGRADED to a JUNIOR SUITE. I arrived on the 27th floor to find my room opposite the elevator (think noisy and you'll be correct) and when I opened the room, it was far from a suite but rather an oversized room with a sofabed and a room meeting table with 4 chairs - stark and uninviting I'd call it. I called the front desk to express my concern about being so close to the noise of people coming and going at the elevators and waited as the phone rang and rang, for over 10 minutes on 2 different attempts to reach someone. I finally gave up as I was heading out for dinner. I tried again when I came home and once again, no once answered. I had a sleepless night with noise from the guests coming and going and when I checked out I expressed my concerns to the front desk agent. She offered a few points, none of which were ever deposited, and that was it! I told her how unhappy I as with the hotel and that Id look to the Westin the future for my Seattle accommodation. She gave me a 'do what you want look'. When I went to retrieve my car, the doorman and parking attendent stood by my car for a full 5 minutes waiting for me with hand out, EXPECTING a tip for what they had done which was part of their job! I felt pressured to leave them each something, their body language and facial expressions screamed 'where is my money' and with disgust I drove away thinking I'll never, never return to the hotel. It has alot of work to do personnel wise.</td></tr>

When we drove up to the curb, the bellmen ignored us--despite that it was pouring rain and snow (Oct 30 storm). I had to get out of the car and ask for help. The bellman said he would help me, so I went back to the car. 10 mins later, he was still tending to other people, hailing cabs. I got out of the car again, to ask for help AGAIN and he said "oh yeah", as if he forgot about me. This was my first impression of the generally unprofessional attitude of the staff. I then waited to 20 mins to check in, just to be told that I could not do so until 3pm! There was only two people checking in dozens and dozens of guests, but the staff were still working at a SNAILS PACE! No sense of urgency at all. I then went to see where my luggage was, so I could figure out what to do with it and was told it would be taken to the storage room until we could check in later. We left and came back later, to check in. Upon return, I waited for another 30 mins in line, just to be told that because I did not have a ticket for my luggage, I could not get it out of the storage room! I walked around, trying to find someone to help me with the situation and saw my luggage just sitting on a luggage cart, in the middle of the lobby! I was furious. We went up to our room and decided to stay indoors, since the storm was so bad outside. Then entire rest of the night, we were awoken by drunken Halloween partiers, because the door was too small from the frame and there was a 1/2 inch gap, which allowed all of the hallway noise to funnel into our room. The next morning, we were up early. We did not have a "do not disturb" sign on the door, but did not think that the housekeeping crew would bother us so early. Wrong. We heard a knock at the door at 8:45. Before we could answer, she just let herself in! I couldn't even believe it. I was so happy when we finally left. NOT a good experience, what-so-ever.</td></tr>

Ive spent over 6 weeks at the Belvoir this year alone and sometimes feel like Im a glutton for punishment. The hotel is finally undergoing an very long overdue $15 million dollar renovation. Until the renovation of the guest rooms is complete, the hotel will be at a disadvantage to any other hotel in the area. In the lobby, you can check out the new fabric, paint chips and floor plan for the renovations, but dont expect to see them anywhere else. The gym, however, just reopened after a major renovation. The service at the hotel is spotty at best. Some of the staff at the front desk is great one guy in particular remembered me by face (not name, thats okay though) and had some great restaurant suggestions. Unfortunately, even though Im platinum, I didnt get any type of room upgrade. However, they did offer a coupon for free sliders at the bar and two free breakfast coupons (the concierge lounge was closed a few days).</td></tr>

It's location is fabulous for keeping yourself entertained. I would even recommend skipping the parks one or two day's to just relax and enjoy all this jem has to offer. ,, relax by one of their pools, play tennis, basketball, miniature golf, or ride on their private lake in a Swan paddle boat (a favorite past time of Michael Jackson when use to frequent the place in the 1990's), ride the water taxi just for fun or to Epcot and Disney Studio's. Stroll down the replica 1930's New Jersey Boardwalk next door, you might run into side walk magician! They have a play ground for the kids and offer children's programs to give you an your mate few hours to yourself if you need a break. Did I mention the fabulous spa or one of more than 8 dining choices including four 4 star choices. Did I mention the Candy shop, ice cream shop and art gallery? Don't even think you have to put on heirs here, it's Disney friendly staff will make you feel at home no matter if you want to dress up for a magnificent meal or just throw on shorts and tee shirt. This hotel was once the only 5 star property at Disney and she has aged magnificently. She is starting to show her age a slight bit accounting for the 4 of 5 star rating I gave her today but, if you want a fantastic resort vacation with your family this place will not disappoint.</td></tr>

I really liked the free access to computers/internet (on large screen monitors) and printersin the lobby! Every staff member I encountered throughout the week was dressed neatly and very professionally in suits; and they were friendly to me whenever I walked through the lobby. A special thanks to Humberto (host/server) who graciously allowed me to read and write in the restaurant near closing time even though I did not buy anything to eat or drink. He was very hospitable to me. My room (#930) was immaculate and comfortable. I would really like to applaud whoever it was that refreshed my room every day. They went the extra mile, keeping the room spotless and stocking the bathroom with extra toiletries which I enjoyed using. Thanks for such a memorable stay that I won't soon forget.

Now why does it cost $10 to simply unload your vehicle and then move the car. It looks to me your valet is trying to make $10 where he can. A hotel of this size has no where to unload.

After a day there, the A/C started leaking, soaking the carpet and leaving a moldy smell for the rest of my stay. I tried repeatedly to get this fixed and was ignored. Service was uneven. I felt treated as a low class citizen compared to the "BPG Elite" customers who frequently get to the front of the rest of us who had been waiting in long lines. To cap off the sub-par experience, at checkout I was surprised to be hit with WiFi fees that had been advertised as free. That took yet another call to management to fix.

Unbelievable! They were so courteous and friendly, we couldn't believe it. Although the hotel is undergoing some renovations, its location is perfect and the amenities noteworthy.

We loved the location which is away from the noise and clamor of Duval Street, across the street from a great beach. Beach is great for sunning, walking or just sitting enjoying the sun and breeze. Easy to get to "the action" on and around Duval Street and the docks. Shuttle transportation is available or rent scooters or bikes. Hotel staff is so acommodating and the rooms are gorgeous. We had a poolside room with great balcony and the mini bar was so nice as we could bring in some snacks or even fix sandwiches in the room. Nice poolside bar/restaurant and the pool is terrific. It is worth the price to have a nice place to stay. There are some less than attractive places in Key West and we were glad we paid a little more to get a great hotel. We don't get down there often and we are happy we picked such a wonderful spot. Go to the La Trattoria restaurant just down the street for a wonderful meal experience.</td></tr>

We usually stay at the Westin or the W Times Square when we come to New York, and I can guarantee we will never ever stay at this Belvoir again.

I have not stayed at a Belvoir in years and it's very unlikely I'll stay again anytime in the near future. This Belvoir had the worst executive lounge I ever experienced. Horrible food, no snacks during the day, no sweets in the evening, no cream for the coffee during the day (sorry, CoffeeMate doesn't cut it). Cheap, cheap, cheap and I had to pay a hefty sum to get access to this poor excuse for a lounge? The service people were very unfriendly, they don't care about keeping the customer happy. They sucker you into not having your room cleaned in exchange for a $5.00 coupon daily for use at their restaurants but its like pulling teeth trying to get the coupons! I was unable to use mine because when I wanted to have dinner in their restaurant, they wouldn't give me the coupons to use! So, I wound up going to a restaurant outside of the hotel. I happen to carry a lot of clout about recommending where drug companies hold their meetings and I can assure you, based on my negative experience at this hotel, it will not be a Belvoir. I wanted to join their rewards program upon check-in but the service person was aloof and had no idea of benefits offered or what it takes to get upgrades. But she had no problem charging me a lot extra for the lounge. I mentioned that I just wanted a look see to compare with other executive lounges that I'm accustomed to, but she said the only way to gain access was by paying the fee. I asked another service person about the location of a nearby restaurant and was pointed in the direction of across the street. He was not specific and it took me 20 minutes to find, very frustrating. I could go on and on but I really did not have a good time at this hotel. Definitely a bad experience for me and very disappointing.</td></tr>

I usually do not come to Philly overnight for these events as I only live in South Jersey. I wanted the weekend to be special as it was my first marathon and we had friends in town from the south who were running in it as well so we decided that the Belvoir would be a great choice. I had booked 2 rooms back in April and though everything was fine. When I checked on my reservations a week before someone at the hotel had cancelled them. We finally got that straightened out and when we arrived to check in both reservations were not in the system. A manager came to the rescue and did handle it very well by placing both rooms side by side and we were satisfied. The room itself was lovely and made up very well for our frustration. Yet, when it came time to sleep that evening, a nightclub across the street was playing music all night that we could actually make out the words to on the 19th floor. We called multiple times to the main desk to ask what was being done but I was met with frustrated attendants and very short tempers. The music did not stop until well past 11pm and I had to wake up at 5am to run in the marathon at 7am. To make matters worse the heater/cooling system did not work as designed and we froze for the night. Needless to say, I did not do as I was expected to perform in the marathon and was disappointed with my stay.</td></tr>

The restaurant food was sub-par (don't order the Caesar salad) and there are not a lot of restaurants closeby within easy walking distance.

I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to unwinding in the hot tub. Instead, I decided to sit in the pool since it was heated. Big mistake! A family with 3 school aged children came shortly after me and one of the children did dive-bombs and spashed water so much that I decided to leave.

I have stayed at the hotel many times before and a charge of $15 was never demanded for the roll away because of my platinum status. I politely asked if she would waive the fee and she rudely said no and your status doesn't matter, "all guests pay the fee" I declined the roll away with the associated fee. She was so rude in fact that the manager of house keeping must have been called by the other desk staff member that witnessed the rudeness because she and a co-worker brought me the roll away for my daughter and profusely apologized for the manager's behavior. She told me that there would be no charge for the roll away and she thanked me for the business. Very nice and it was just a shame that she had to apologize for the manager.</td></tr>

It's not a 5-star property, but it was clean and perfect for our needs. I'm puzzled at the remarks about the staff, but they were very helpful for us and took extra time to help us find our way around town and find attractions that would be suitable for our family. The price was also very attractive.</td></tr>

The person at the front desk couldn't tell me how I would get my BPG free breakfast, or the hours of the bar, or any other information. I was literally tossed the key to my room and that was the end of discussion. Our room was intentionally poolside so we could make use of the pool, yet at any given point in time the pool was PACKED from opening to closing, many of whom were not guests at the hotel. The surrounding area left much to be desired - there was only an Applebees and a 7-Eleven within a mile of the hotel - we had to travel three exits on the highway to a diner!</td></tr>

What they didnt say is that we would be charged per person for a few mins of access to the hotel. Upon check out they asked for $160 for the extra wrist bands and wouldn't sympathize with us not knowing the cost. Who in there right mind would agree to such terms.</td></tr>
