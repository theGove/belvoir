If you need peace and quiet, this isn't for you",4,Majoring in Mediocrity,"There was nothing terrible about our stay but lots of little annoyances that add up to wishing we had been somewhere else. Our king bed reservation turned into 2 doubles and the person who checked us in insisted they were 2 queens--which is why we took the room. She should have been better informed. She also knew nothing about the gold welcome amenity and had to ask someone else. Our room had a broken safe and we had to call for service on it twice which made us late for where we were going. I had lots of trouble with the computer in the lobby, and the set-up is such that everyone in that lobby can see what you're working on. That's flat out wrong. I even get the idea of creating more energy and connectedness in the lobby by putting the work stations there, but give people a little personal privacy when they're on the computer. And the elevators took too long. Too many people coming and going--like a factory. And finally, I can't believe they are still charging $10 a day for the fitness center. Come on people. If you have to charge, make this one of the gold amenities. I didn't need that free drink. I need a workout in the morning. I am a committed BPG member but I would only stay here with points, I would never pay to stay here."

The staff was pleasant and graceous, however, It took us 2 hours, yes TWO, to check in. During this time they did offer refreshments, but what I really wanted was to get settled. Murmurs through the crowd were they're just not prepared to handle large crowds. Are you kidding me? They sit next door to the convention center. Crowds should be their speciality. Once our room assignments were given we arrived on the 8th floor to piles of laundry on the floor outside of rooms. I was skeptical as I entered my room, which was okay. Didn't eat there as prices were exorbitant and again long lines. Check out made easy on the TV wasn't working , so back to standing in another line. Overall VERY disappointing. I've stayed at lesser hotels with more attention to the customer."

There were two used 'contact lens' on the floor when I arrived - and I don't wear contact lens - so they were not mine. So this means that the maid didn't vacuum the floor from the previous occupant. All-in-all - - my stay was excellent and I would stay again and highly recomment it to others.

We are from Atl, and was required to stay in town for 3 days. When I booked the reservation, I was told $129 for first night & $151 for 2nd night and it was a breakfast & bed package. I did not get the B & B for Tues because I had surgery that morning and could not eat anything. On Tues during my surgery, my husband returned to the hotel to update our room key, because the gal told us in would expire at noon. While she was updating his key, she handed him a breakfast card with May 1st on it, so he then had pancakes before returning to the hosp. The next morning, we went down for our breakfast, and the waitress said that he had used up our free breakfast the day before, therefore we needed to pay for our 2 breakfasts. I didn't think much of it, thought it was just a little mess-up. I then reviewed our portfolio from both nights and was shocked to see several charges that were incorrect. At 11:30 when I approached the hotel desk, the woman was very rude and could not explain all our extra charges. She called the food manager, which seem odd to me because she didn't handle to charges. The two of them scambled for about 25 mins, looking at food receipts trying to prove that I was wrong. I have never had this type of unprofessional treatment at any up scaled hotel! When I left the hotel, they still didn't have it straightened out and assured me they would call or email me ASAP, as of today all I've recieved is the same bill from that morning.

To start with I was told over the phone when I booked that I would have a room with a microwave and a fridge, that I would have free internet access, and that a late check out due to the marathon would be no problem. While arriving at the hotel, I was unaware of the parking situation in Columbus so I was a bit confused about what I needed to do. I had one staff member outside tell me while I was waiting behind several vehicles that valet parking was free for those staying for the marathon. At this point I had already been through 2 hours of hunting for parking places through surrounding garages and it was getting late. When the staff member got to me to take my car he told me it was a $30 charge, completely different than what I was just directed. Because I had already been waiting for so long and needed to make the marathon dinner, I was just going to pay it. He then told me i couldn't pay with a credit card and I would have to go get cash. At this point I was already ready to call the hotel and cancel my stay, but I didn't. I found a parking spot at the columbus commons parking area that a random person outside told me about. While checking in I was there was only one room option available regardless of what I was guaranteed over the phone, so I had no fridge or microwave for food options. By the time I got checked into the hotel it was later than the marathon dinner event they were holding. The phone in my room didn't work so every time I needed something I had to use my cell phone. I called a staff member who said he would bring me a menu and that he could have the kitchen make a pasta dish for me if I go down to the lounge. I went into the lounge and they told me they don't do special dishes and I have to order what is offered at those times on their menu. It was almost 1030 pm and I hadn't eaten dinner yet. I couldn't leave the hotel out of fear that I would run into loss of parking spots again because of the number of people in town for this event. From here I spoke to a lady at the front desk who gave me a catering menu of delivery options. I went back upstairs to my room and called and they were closed. It took everything to not call the manager and ask for my money back. I wasn't in marathon event mode anymore and was about to skip everything and drive back home. I spoke to another gentleman who gave me pizza places who will deliver. I tried to log onto my laptop to look at pizza menu when it asked me to pay for this service. So when i called the front desk she told me this service is only available to certain rooms. Once again I had been given false information from several different staff members. I called pizza hut and ordered something simple. The guy who delivered the order called me when he arrived to the hotel and told me that the people at the front desk were not letting him come up to the room. They even commented to me when I let them know how my night has been so far- that it isn't their fault I didnt make it in time for the runners dinner. But my wait for valet parking and the run around from employees outside had a huge part to deal with how late I was able to check in. I was beyond angry at this point. I'm a very patient person but I didn't know how much more I could handle from this hotel. I went to bed after eating with the hopes that the next day would be a new day. After the marathon event I came to my room and called the front desk just to confirm that I was okayed the late checkout. I didnt want to deal with interuptions while getting cleaned up after the race. The gentleman I spoke with was very rude to me and asked who I talked to because they never allow late check outs and I should be charged for this. I told him the lady who said this was ok and he said ok fine but we never do this just for future reference and hung up on me. While I was in the shower I had someone knock on my door several times. I'm assuming it was housekeeping and they weren't informed of my late checkout. So it wasn't just a fluke that the first night was horrible for me- the whole experience at this hotel was bad from beginning to end. The cost of this hotel is not cheap compared to others. To not have a complimentary breakfast, free internet service, and deal with all of the complications of food ordering, nonworking phone in the room, no fridge or microwave- this stay wasn't even close to worth what I paid. I'm leaving this lengthy review so everyone can see the details of what happened. All of the staff members at this hotel need to be on the same page because I was given a different story the whole time. Employees should know what food options are available for guests who aren't from around there and whether parking is free, and they should see what you were guaranteed on the phone while booking the hotel room. I will never ever stay here again. I will still be calling about this experience as well. I stay in hotels on a frequent basis and this was the worst experience I have ever had!!"

Some of the bathroom lightbulbs were out in the vanity area making lighting very dim in the area. Furnishings are starting to show wear. Both the corridors and elevators had a very strange odor.

This is after waiting another 30 minutes in line to speak with someone at the desk. The front desk is far too understaffed. The hotel charges some $14 a day for resort fee including two bottles of water. We did not receive any water during the stay. Instead we called the desk and they said we could come down and get it...really? Just another way they attempt to scam you. The door to our room was broken and nothing was done to fix it.

I had booked a suite because I wanted extra space due to a knee injury which requires crutches and a wheelchair. When we got to the room, the layout was very cramped and awkward. When I called the front desk to ask if there was another suite, 2 Nicoles and the Asst. Mgr worked with my situation and offered to upgrade us to the Governor Suite at no extra charge which had a much more open floor plan and worked out perfectly! Thanks so much!! Also, special thanks to Beverly in the Club Lounge for being so friendly and helpful and arranging for us, my daughter and her boyfriend to be able to order room service right in the lounge! Thanks to Linda from room service who was kind enough to come up and take our orders and bring them to us in the lounge on the evening of the 10th. At approximately 5:45am on May 12 the fan or vent right over our bed started making a horrible, loud grinding noise and woke me up. Special thanks to Tom at the front desk for being sympathetic but informing us that maintenance did not arrive until after 7am and assuring us that someone would come take a look at it as soon as they came in. The noise continued for over an hour, making it impossible to get back to sleep. When it suddenly stopped at around 7:00, I spoke to Tom again and informed him and he said he would make a note and have someone check on it after we checked out and offered us free breakfast coupons. The noise came back for about 5 minutes once later. Check out was a computerized mess. We were charged for the first night separately because the second night was on points but apparently they had charged the card we gave them at check in (even though we had said we would be changing card at check out) without giving us the itemized bill under the door for us to check on! When we had returned to the hotel on the evening of the 11th, our keycards did not work and had to be reprogrammed, and a new $50 deposit had to be left for the second night, which was inconvenient and confusing When my husband tried to use the card to get up to the club lounge for breakfast in the morning, it didnt work for that either. When he went to the desk, the woman told him that since the room was under my name, I would have to come down with ID to authorize the card or something but since he didnt want me to have to come downstairs on my crutches or in the wheelchair, he told her nevermind. At check out, Kyle was very nice and apologetic about all the mix ups.

The reality on the hotel beach has nothing to do with the beach reviews as well. While we were actually physically there on the beach it featured 1 foot high piles of stinking sea vegetation, the sand is full of cigarette filters, beer bottle capsules and even some used condoms. Homeless have settled underneath the pergolas. Forget the romantic walk on sun down. Past the multi-lingual beggars and the pot smokers you have to fight a myriad of flies."

I was told there was no problem. When we arrived I was told the room I had reserved was not available, even though I had called to confirm earlier in the day. All they had was a king corner room. I showed the agent my confirmation for a king room with a sofa, (we prefer not to sit on the bed due to back issues), she told me that it was just a request and not a guarantee. She also said I was lucky to even have a room because they were booked up with a basketball tournament and two weddings. One of the elevators was out of service and it took forever to get to our room or to the lobby all weekend. The other elevators had wet floors every single time we got in them. I know that is to be expected when there is a pool, but it was a dangerous situation. Our room, being a corner room, was the very last room at the end of the hall. The light bulb in the bathroom was out, we had to call maintenance to have it fixed. We went to the lounge to have a drink and it was over flowing. There was no policing of the lounge. There was one person staying on the floor that brought an entire basketball team in the lounge and was proud of the fact that they had gotten away with it. So of course there was no soda or water left in the fridge and no snacks to be found. It was also impossible to get a glass of wine or beer as the attendant was nowhere to be found. The scene was the same if not worse in the morning for breakfast, it was a mess, and there was nothing to eat except some bread for the toaster and clumpy oatmeal. There was no silverware or plates or glasses and as each player left the coach was reminding them to take two or three drinks for later. It was extremely frustrating as a paying guest to not be able to use the amenities I paid for."

There is a quiet adult pool and a much larger family pool area with water slides and water features. Overall, the front desk and valet staff were very professional, welcoming, and accommodating. The rooms are spare and somewhat small, although I expected this based on website pictures and other reviews. However, I was surprised how generally banged up all the furniture was. The room was clean, but all the scratches and dents made it seem less so. The bath is very basic, with no upgraded finishes, but it served its purpose. The mattress was comfortable. Note: partial ocean view was quite removed from the sound/smell of the waves because this is a very large property. Note: if you're not a super-attractive 40's mother or one of her beautiful daughters, save yourself the money for surf/paddle board instruction from the gruff old teacher. He and his staff pay plenty of attention to such travelers (while providing their off-color commentary while the women are out of hearing range). Everyone else gets the short end of the stick. Overall, this place serves the purpose well for someone wanting full access to the sights, sounds, and nightlife of Waikiki, with a comfortable place to rest their head at night."

Its not the best or newest of hotels but its suited my business needs until my last experience. I arrived at the hotel at 10pm after coming in from London via Boston. Went to check in but was told the room wasnt available as it hadnt been cleaned. Receptionist said that it would take 30 to 60 minutes. I wasnt happy but these things happen occasionally so I was prepared to live with this if it wasnt going to take more than an hour and I told the reception this. It got to midnight and no one had spoken to me and there was a large line building in reception: i wasnt alone. Lined up for nearly 40 minutes. At around 1am, the reception said that they were not able to provide me with a room (along with about 20 other guests) but they had organised a room at a motel. They provided me with $40 for cab fare. This motel was about 30 mintues (at 1am mind you) out of baltimore and cost $55. It took another hour to get checked in as there were many other people from the Belvoir there. Got a room and the condition of this room was unbelievable. Lock on the door didnt work, stains on nearly every fabric of the room and basically I didnt feel safe. I got to bed at around 3am but had to be back at the Belvoir for a car to pick me up at 7am. Total nightmare. I cant believe this is a Belvoir Hotel. I've never experienced this at a hotel of this alleged level. The staff were doing the best they could but there appeared to be no one in charge: management of the situation was severely lacking. I go to Baltimore regularly and luckily I have some choice where I stay. In conclusion...1. I wont be going back to this hotel; and 2. I will be recommending to my company to remove this hotel from the preferred list. For a business traveller (and any traveller/guest) the experience was unacceptable."

However, the disparity in of service received at the various properties needs focus. I might as well had walked in off the street and begged for a room at this hotel. First of all, upon checking in I was told there were no upgrades available and I would be required to stay on a low floor with zero view. Fine. Not a big deal. However, my floor was on a separate elevator bank than the lounge. So I had to travel all the way down and back up to go to the lounge. Not a huge deal, but you would think they could accommodate me on the same set of floors with a common elevator bank. Secondly, the TV did not work well in my room (the picture was fuzzy). I told the desk, but it was never fixed. In addition, my room was conveniently located near the elevator and across from the ice machine to make for a very noisy background and it looked like every room on the floor had a paper in front of their door in the morning except my room. The final kicker was when it started to rain and I had to run out for a meeting. I called guest services and the Concierge to get an umbrella. Apparently there was not a single umbrella in the hotel to lend to a platinum guest. Maybe someone should be sent out to buy a dozen for a rainy day. Good idea? None of these items are a big deal in the large scope of things, but this lack of small services is a far cry from the type of attention paid to valuable customers at other properties."

The servers manning the Club Room for breakfast were excellent, but the ones in the evening were not. In fact, when the food ran out, that was it, even crackers! We would like to suggest adult hours for the pool. As late as 9:40 PM, adults could not even have a conversation by the pool because there were so many screaming, splashing children. I know this is not the hotel's fault, but adult-only hours could help to alleviate this problem. I also know we were not the only ones affected by this since others in the elevator discussed their leaving for the same reason. The morning we left, we needed a cab just before 7 AM. No one was outside except a member of the cleaning crew. He kindly stopped and asked if we needed a cab. He then whistled for one and refused to take a tip. I so wish I had gotten his name because he was very kind and did a job that was not his own."

I never received a phone call, and later that evening when we returned to the hotel, I had to re-explain the situation to the front desk staff to claim our rooms. After receiving our new room keys, our group went back to our single temporary room to gather our belongings, except our key cards no longer worked and someone else was in the room. Turns out the hotel staffed moved all of our belongings into the new hotel rooms without notifying me as they previously agreed to. This is unnacceptable. They did not have our rooms ready, there was no communication, and they management did not have our permission to move our belongings. They screwed up big time. I will never use book with Belvoir hotels ever again."

I was denied access to the lounge, but after some haggling, my room was upgraded. I was told this hotel would not recognize my platinum status because I booked through a third party. This was the first time I heard of this news considering I booked through a third party three times within the last month for BPG hotels. I would not stay here again."

The Downtown Belvoir satifies the highest standards a traveler like myself requires. They offer great accomodations, excellent food, phenominal service. The staff, from the parking garage through the wait staff, to everyone you encounter on the property is wonderfully friendly and helpful. I will not consider another location when I am in the Philadelphia area."

The hotel is convenient to the airport and the shuttle driver was very friendly and professional. However, the front desk attendant was unfriendly upon check in. I asked what my breakfast options were for the next morning, since each hotel is different with the platinum benefit. He told me I wasn't platinum in a condescending tone. The whole conversation was generally condescending and unfriendly. I corrected him and resolved the situation, but the manner he spoke to me in at first was very unprofessional and unnecessary. The room was okay. I was traveling with my girlfriend and two others and shared just one room. The beds are tiny for two people, just double beds. The layout of the room and bathroom was a little odd, but it was clean and good size. For breakfast we ate in the Belvoir Club. In one word, awful. The quality and selection was poor. (1 picked over fruit plate, a few pieces of bread/bagels for toast, and some dry scrambled eggs). The attendant was uninterested and was watching the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and later the a special on Soul Train on the Club's TV during breakfast service. The service we received was just not acceptable. I think the hotel has a lot of potential because the overall property is nice, but the service was not anywhere near Grandbourne's standard."

For so long I missed having an BPG hotel in Stamford. This hotel opened up and it has surpassed anything I could have expected. The staff is exceptional. From the front desk to the Club Lounge hostess, the janitorial staff, the employees you meet in the hallway. Everyone was warm, friendly, smiling. We were checking out, my five year old son had a frown, and the front desk attendant ( how could I have forgotten her name!) stopped what she was doing to inquire what was wrong. He told her he was hungry, and she went and got him a snack! By the way, the wait staff at the restaurant is great! Definitely will stay there again. I stayed in a suite, and it was bigger than a NYC apartment."
