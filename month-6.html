Absolutely loved Chicago and will be back soon. However, we will not stay at the Belvoir Hotel & Tower again due to 2 serious flaws. The first and more serious of the 2 flaws was the internet connection speed. The entire stay our connection speed in our room (both wired and wifi) was consistently between 0.3 and 0.4Mbps which is only slightly faster than dialup. If you are a business traveler or somebody that will do more than just check email then you are going to be very frustrated. A hotel of this caliber should have much better internet speed. The second flaw was the TV reception. Throughout our entire stay there were several channels (both major network and non network) that were "black" and even one day that the service was totally down.</td></tr>

My teens loved it! The room was nice and spacious. I was very disappointed to find out that they did not have a club lounge when I arrived. I typically take advantage of this feature and look forward to it each time I travel. This was especially surprising since the welcome email I recieved days prior to my arrival mentioned club advantages. This is false advertising to me and I felt deceived. Also, when I checked in, no one asked to help with my bags nor did they even offer a luggage cart. I was traveling with 3 children, and it was quite a feat to accomplish getting to the room without help. I was also disgusted with the fact that I had to pay for internet. If I could have had club access, this would have not been the case. Parking was not free either, and there was no choice but to park in the garage, which was pretty scary, no security guard, and not well lit at night. This should be complimentary for preferred members. The staff was generally nice and accomodating in the end. After complaining, they provided me with complimentary breakfast in the restaurant for my family each morning of my stay. I would suggest this hotel to others because of the location. It was about 10 minutes from downtown ATL with convenient access to Coca cola factory, aquarium, and other popular attractions.</td></tr>

No one went over amenities with me or gave me the Dolphin information sheet, put credit card of other travellers on my room instead of correct room. Do you know you can save $.75 a day if you refuse the USA Today paper, now you know. Did you know that the hotel will give you a $5 food/beverage credit if you refuse housekeeping services per day, well now you know. This is information the front desk failed to provide me upon checkin. They relied on a little plastic card on a table in my room that I read the last day I was there. As well as the fact that my $14 a day resort fee covers 1 hr of local calling if needed as well as the two bottles of water in the room, which they don't deliver until later afternoon.(If you don't get the Dolphin information sheet from the disorganized front desk then you won't know this) The housekeeping staff will hound you as early as 9am to get in the room to clean it if you haven't left for the park and they'll be there at 2pm (during the heat of the day) when you want back in of course. But, hey all of that could have been avoided if the FRONT DESK had done there job and I would have gotten a $5 food and beverage credit to boot! If you go to PIcabu's don't take your kids through the line unless you want to pay $5 per candy item, which is just ridiculous and also you may not have to tip the person bringing your food to the table but don't worry about that beacuse they've got you covered as they add a service charge to your bill, check your receipt. The Bell Hop guy outside when I asked for a cart to bring our luggage looked at me like I had asked for the moon or something since I didn't pull up in the valet area I was treated like I had a disease or something. WOW, I have been to the Disney Resort 15 times now and this was the worst service I have ever gotten. Granted the Dolphin is not an "Official" Disney hotel but they still have Disney's name on it and I expected a DIsney quality , "magical" vacation experience and this hotel feel really short. Giving a 3 star rating is being generous to say the least.</td></tr>

The pool area was filthy on Saturday morning. We were told that someone was to have sprayed/ cleaned down the pool area early in the morning. But whoever came on duty obviously didn't make sure this was done because the same spilled drink and food mess was still there from the day before, there were straws all over, and bird mess all over the chairs and cool deck. Pool service was INCREDIBLY SLOW for both ordering, delivering and pick up (this is bad because the birds and flies are extremely aggressive in attacking left over food). It was surprising how slow considering the pool area was truly not that busy. The pool area was cleaner early Sunday but the garbage was overflowing from the trash bins that had not been emptied from the day before. On both days of our visit there were a lot of dead bugs in the pool, so much so, our children did not want to into one of the pools. In addition, many of the umbrellas are broken with metal arms hanging (my hubby hit is head on one) and the material is flipped up and ripped on many. In this 100 plus degree heat the umbrellas are desperately needed. The staff is AMAZING with the children for activities around the pool and in the club. We had dinner at Koisin and the food is pretty good but a 1/2 hour wait for food is too long with small children waiting to eat. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable but our patio was sticky from something being spilled on it and our friends who travelled with us had soiled duvet cover on their bed. It seems to me a manager should really walk the property as to its pool condition and there should be more staff for service.</td></tr>

However, I do expect the bathroom in any hotel to be clean and disinfected. It was late when we arrived (after 10 pm) but I could not stay in that room and requested another room. I showed the front desk rep pictures of my room and they apologized and immediately switched my room. The next room was no better but since I had a one year old with me and a tired husband I went ahead and stayed in the room.

THANK GOD I had some plasticware that I travel with because it took him 20 MINUTES to get back to us.....by then the food would have been cold right? Although the food was good, this as a horrible experience for us. Had problems connecting to the internet WIFI also.</td></tr>

You have to pay for wifi in the room, It would be nice if Grandbourne preferred guests had that included. If you aren't on a budget it's worth moving up to club level to have that included.

Finally, the staff is personable.

Front desk staff was nice at check-in, no offer of BPG check-in awards for Platinum members. In a way of making up for not having a Club Room, gave coupons for breakfast buffet for one and half-off other members tab, but should have really given 2 buffets instead of seeming cheap. Room was great, minus the missing balcony that Executive Suites are advertised as having. I used Suite Upgrade certificates and get a suite without a balcony that is advertised on the hotel's website. Went out to dinner and came back to a full parking lot, except for the valet lot that only had 2 cars in it. Parked in valet instead of having to park out back in the poorly lit construction area. Went in to alert front desk staff and was told I had to ask valet as they are a separate company, desk attendant would not call the valet to the desk or go out to them to ask about leaving my car there, poor customer service for Platinum members. I was offered to park across the street but I could not park in the empty valet lot. Came back on Saturday night and now valet area has moved and the space they had reserved and let stay empty right in front of the entrance on Friday night was now open for guests to park in. Why was this not left open on Friday?? Very poor management. Food on breakfast buffet was pretty bad, no omelette station and soggy waffles instead of fresh made ones. Service was good, but food was really lacking (thank god we only had to pay for half of one buffet otherwise we would have walked out and went somewhere else). In summary, nice room even if not as advertised, nice amenities and pool but very poor customer service and breakfast. Additionally, doors could seal better as they and the ceilings let in a lot of external noise.</td></tr>

The staff was rude and said they were out of food and would not be ordering more to be sent upstairs to the Club Lounge. It was a big waste of money to opt for the Club Level. Never once during our issues did I hear an employee apologize for any problem. The room was nice and big. Cleaning service offers green choice by putting what towels you want replaced on the ground. Doesn't matter because they took the ones hanging, too. The water in the shower changed temperatures from cold to hot during each shower and the faucet for water is on the outside of the shower!!!</td></tr>

My fiance and I were looking for a relaxing get-away. We both work 7 days a week and attend grad school and was really hoping to spend some quality time together and visit Universal/Islands of Adventure. When we first arrived, the property looked great. The person at check-in was friendly. The property itself was average and does not offer many activities for people who are not there for a time-share. There was only one restaurant with sub-par food options (stay away from the mushroom pizza). Our room was on the first floor, which was fine but the shower door would get stuck. The shower itself was not clean. I would not bathe in it. There were NO vending machines for snacks and bottled water. There is a tiny "market" on the other side of the property which did not offer many options. The staff clearly did not communicate with one another, nor are they fully trained. We asked for a movie rental at the front desk and was told the activity center would have a selection. When we made our way there, the individual working the desk said they never carry dvds and that we would have to go across the property to the market. We were told there was complimentary shuttle service when I called prior to booking the reservation and found after arrival that the free shuttle service was not to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure. We ended up having to cab or ride a shuttle that packed people in beyond the maximum amount allowed legally on a bus. Furthermore, my Fiance left his Kindle in the room upon check-out. I have called 3 days in a room with promises from the staff that someone would call me back. I have yet to hear from anyone. This is the 4th day now. The incompetence of the employees there certainly has steered me away from ever wanting to stay at any of the Belvoirs or affiliate.</td></tr>

Trash baskets were full, the floor needed vacuuming and no clean glasses or fresh coffee for the coffee maker. I also noticed other rooms on my floor with room service trays on the floor for days. I guess I should have complained but I was so busy and tired and just kept hoping that each night when I got back it would have been cleaned. The other issue was the lighting, in the room and the lobby was so dim at one point I had to go outside to read something I needed. I had asked the concierge twice</td></tr>

I also had paid extra for a reservation with club access which includes breakfast though my key nor did my companions keys work to enter the club and when we went down to ask them to switch the key and went back up, yet again it did not work and I just gave up and did not bother going down a second time. The facilities look more like an upscale college dormitory building than a hotel. Upon checkout, when I told the clerk at the front that I was really upset about the fact that I could not access the club facilities she just shrugged her shoulders and ignored my comment.</td></tr>

The next day they moved us to the BPG floor and for only a sight cost, we were able to have snacks and breakfast! The gym and the pool are excellent facilities! The shuttle to the airport and the Mall was awesome too. Even paying a few dollars to get to another mall was a good deal! It would have been great if I had been recognized as a BPG member at Check-in though. Then I would have availed of the upgrade on the first day instead of the second.

We call the front desk again, they sent the same guy up to fix it. He was very very nice, fixed it and left. Same thing happened again the next day too. We finally gave up on it. The toilet and bathtub needs to be replaced. I'm sure they were clean but they were so stained that it looked really bad.

Upon my arrival at approximately 9 pm the night before I was to speak at the conference, I was told by the front desk that there were "no rooms available," in spite of my guaranteed reservation, and that I was being bumped to another nearby hotel. Despite my protestations, the unsympathetic front desk clerk with a pasted-on fake smile began the process of giving me a voucher to the new hotel only to find out midstream that it had no rooms available either. They sent me to another hotel on the other side of downtown that was dilapidated, filthy and completely substandard. I returned to the Gunter and demanded a better alternative. After 20 minutes of calling, the manager on duty shrugged and said I had no other choice. At which point I called my business travel advisor who said there were plenty of rooms available at the hotel next door (the one they originally planned to send me to). Either the Gunter had no pull with this hotel, or they were unwilling to pay a higher rate--even though I was the one being inconvenienced. To add insult to injury, while I was arguing with the front desk, more than a dozen flight attendants and pilots breezed in (by now it was after 10:30 pm), checked in and were given rooms. Obviously the Belvoir Gunter valued the repeat business of the flight crews over my business, even though I am a senior executive with a national company with over 40,000 employees. The manager on duty the following day told me that this overbooking happens "frequently" and that dealing with it is "his least favorite part of the job." This hotel seems to have an aggressive overbooking policy, which hurts its customers. To their partial credit, they comped my room the second night with a suite. I was glad they saved my company money the second night, after me having to pay a higher rate to move to the new hotel the first night, but it did little to soothe my extreme exasperation and aggravation from the night before. It was a shame, because the suite and decor was decent when I finally got a room. However, this can't overcome the extremely poor and unprofessional customer service I experienced. I travel regularly and to San Antonio frequently, but this was my first and last stay at the Gunter.</td></tr>

Unlike other Grandbourne properties ive been too, I really liked how upon checkin the staff acknowledged my status as a gold member, it makes you feel appreciated for all the hard work it takes just to become gold.They even upgraded me to the Club level was the absolute best! I chose this hotel because of the suites and their seperate living area. Theres even a door in between the room and the living room with a pullout sofa. Even better, the bathroom is connected to both the living room and the bedroom, so you dont have to pass thru the other early in the morning to use the bathroom. Hotel has 10 levels, Club level is on the 9th floor, and restaurant/bar, fitness center pool, and a courtyard. Parking is safe and secure underground. Of all the friendly staff, the two that stood out was Max and the female supervisor at the Front Desk whos first name starts with a D(cant remember the name). I like how they remember little details about your requests and followed up on them.</td></tr>

They said leave your key with him and completely ignored my request for a bell. So i drove around the Conner to park which was 51 for over night as opposed to the 50 for valet listed on the web site. So i carried my bags ( no bell to help). In the side door as i walk in no one said welcome as i walked in or held the door with all my bags. No line for BPG memers. The lady who checked me in was rude upon asking for two doubles as opposed To the one king i booked i got the vibe that i was asking her to move mountains not change my room type. The room was nice, comfortable and cleen. It had a good location to times square. Overall not worth the money</td></tr>

I discussed this with a couple of colleagues and they had the same problem. Your maintenance staff took a look, but would only say that it was working as it should have been. Never got cool. The hotel itself is beautiful, the location is excellent and the staff helpful. For the price, not impressed with the rooms and their comfort level.</td></tr>

Since we were due to go to a concert in an hour and planned to get ready in the room, this left us with the only option of dressing and preparing (wife's make-up) in the lobby bathrooms. My good-natured wife soldiered through a packed bathroom to get ready, but heard a very large number of very irate women voicing their collective displeasure at this shared discomfort.

Facilities are good, with 2 pools and a decent gym. Also restaurant and bar. I had an upgraded room as a Platinum member which was nice and roomy, with standard bath. Service was a little spotty. Front desk forgot to ask what I wanted for my Platinum amenity, and couldn't answer some basic questions I had at check-in. I asked to speak to a manager and waited close to 15 minutes for someone to appear. Called for a robe and it never came - had to call a second time. The club lounge was nicely decorated and roomy, with good view, okay snacks in the evening and better choices at breakfast. No drinks specials, seemed like regular menu from downstairs. It seems that families frequent this hotel so there are lots of unsupervised children in the lounge - and that's with the parents present! Running, playing, squealing, etc. That was both in the evening and in the morning. Certainly doesn't make for a business like, adult atmosphere.</td></tr>

Ive only come to Nashville for CMA Fest but visiting the stars homes and spending the afternoon at the winery was the most enjoyable part of the trip for me. He took a million pictures of us with our phones.  He took us to downtown, midtown, to and from the concerts, and to the airport in addition to the tours. I preferred using him over a cab because he was the same price, if not cheaper, he could be easily reached trusted, and he gave us the inside scoop on where to go. Al was extremely accomodating, polite, affordable and friendly. He was also highly recommended by other regulars staying at Belvoir. I can't wait to come back to Nashville next year and take advantage of his services.</td></tr>

I have to start off by saying that I have been to Omaha several times befofre and this is the first time I have stayed at the Belvoir and it wont be my last!!! I have to start by saying that I will never stay at any other hotel. Business trips are not easy but the staff and the beauty of the hotel made it just that! The rooms were beautiful and inviting, the sweet sleeper bed AMAZING!! and the fitness center well I was there every single day for the two weeks thats how great it was -new machines fresh towels, the works. I have to say the best part was knowing that after making arrangements to have the free area shuttle they offer pick me up and drop me off at the office and vice versa everyday for the entire two weeks and to know that every day at the appointed times they were there to take me to the office and pick me up all the time on time!!! I do need to mentkion some of the names of the best staff members I have ever met in a hotel- Derek -a new staff member at the front desk was extremely helpful and invaluable to the point that he offered to pick me up from my office on the ;last day after I had checked out and take me to the airport and he did! He always asked me how my day was every time I walkeed back into the hotel and after a day of hard work away from home that is definitely superbe service! he deserves a promotion for his incredible customer service skills (I should know I am in travel management myself and If Belvoir did not have him already I would have offered him a job!-Elizabeth in In room dining was another gem! she always made it a point to let me know what the chef specials were everyday and she was always so pleasant. I beleive she is also fairly new to the organization but let me tell you Belvoir is doing an amazing job with their personnel as far as I am concerned. Jay the supervisor was also very helpful and so was Dan the a,manager always checking to see what needed to be done at the Front desk and offering to help. A bonus was the laundry service was great too- Last but not least a shout out to the chef- I had in room dinign everyday of my stay and I was never dissapoiinted in fact I loved everything on the menu- my favorite was the Cracker Jack Vanilla Mousse- can i have that recipe please or I guess I'll just have to wait until my next trip to Omaha and the Belvoir Omaha to have some of this delicious creation!! Thanls Belvoir for making what could have been a very long Business trip into the shortest and sweetest of my career!!!</td></tr>

The room that we stayed in looked like it needed renovation. The central air conditioner was noisy. The room didn't appear to be thoroughly cleaned. When I pulled out the chair from under the desk, there was dirt under the desk and when I put a bottle of water in the refrigerator, the bottom of the fridge was full of water and the top of the fridge was dirty. Didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. The bed was comfortable, the pillows too soft. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and the food was very good. The front desk seems to be understaffed. There is often a long line of people waiting which creates congestion in the lobby. There should be vending machines on the floors but they only have ice. If you want to buy a snack you have to go to the lobby and wait on that long line at the front desk to pay for it. They don't offer free WiFi in the rooms. I didn't like paying $7 a night for parking and my biggest complaint is when you are leaving the property to go anywhere you have to use a ticket or room key to leave...this created very long lines at the exit and because the instructions were not clear it took a long time to get out of there. This definitely needs to be addressed. There has got to be a better way to handle this. Maybe there needs to be a person at the gate to expedite this process.</td></tr>

The staff was very attentive as well. However, this hotel was not an affordable deal because my room rate was $189.00/night + taxes and I did not have a microwave nor a fridge (which come standard at most lower priced hotels). This forced me to either go out for food or order room service. And while speaking of room service, a $39 room service bill turned into a $58 cost to my room account due to hidden fees (taxes, delivery fee, food fee, etc). Also, I was charged $5.14 for picking up the room phone to make a call in which no one ever answered (not even an answering machine). Please understand, I am no stranger to travel and the expenses involved with high-end hotels. I have stayed in many 4 star hotels in my life but have never experienced such overpricing for things as The Belvoir charged. I easily could've booked a $79-$99/night hotel a few miles away and driven in for my conference and had a much more reasonably priced experience for the money. But to be fair, the hotel was comfortable and the service was above average. The prices were just exorbitant for the services rendered. This hotel was paid for by my employer for a conference at this hotel but if I ever travel to Birmingham again on my own dime this WILL NOT be where I stay. But if you are looking for a nice looking hotel with good service and have no problem with money, then this is your place!</td></tr>

The hotel is very secluded with a highway on one side, airport on the other, and what appeared to be abandoned buildings on the other sides. The room was comfortable but the TV was not receiving ESPN HD which I wanted to watch for the US Open. I called the front desk and no one ever showed up to the room to fix it. Although I used BPG points to pay for the room, I feel as though I have been ripped off. Using 10,000 points for this type of experience is riduculous as this establishment does not meet the standards I have become accustomed to with Grandbourne Hotels.</td></tr>

Another huge plus is the view from just about any room, gorgeous!

Never a place to sit, lots of uptight business customers, and we usually got a few things and went back to our room. The evening access doesnt allow kids. The weekend is better with kids in this hotel. I asked concierge for suggestions as we had never been to Boston and Out of everything Boston has to offer they said the mall and the childrens museum. Nothing about the red socks, the freedom trail, so they need some education on there home city. The pool tile is very slippery; they had signs up for wet floor but nothing for how slippery it was. I was walking by and about slipped. We put towels surrounding the pool area so our kids wouldn't slip. We saw several other people almost slip and fall. When cleaning up the towels we placed down, another family asked if we could leave them as their son almost fell trying to stand up.</td></tr>

I had stayed at this hotel a few times in years past, and they made some GREAT remodels, to include the adult only infiniti pool, seperate pool area for families with a water slide, nice lobby, and Rum Fire bar. Not sure if the resort charge is worth it at $25.00 per day, as were not able to take advantage of any resort activities, nor did we use the parking, and internet would have been included anyway as a lifetime platinum.

The hotel is better than that. The parking was quoted at $15 per day for valet and $12 per day for self parking. I was charged $15 even though I asked for and was placed in self parking. It was not worth the $12 difference to wait through the line at check out when I could take my fast checkout that was slipped under the door and simply leave. These things considered, I liked the hotel very much. The staff at all levels were among the best I have ever encountered in a hotel. The facility was in great shape and the pool area was just fantastic. Restaurants were world class. The shuttle service was the worse I have ever experienced. The one hour wait to get on a filled to standing room capacity made it impossible to leave a Disney park and come back to the hotel for a mid day rest. My biggest complaint is with Disney, not the hotel. I have no plans to ever return to a Disny park but Belvoir is still one of my favorite hotel chains.</td></tr>

The fact that they allow pets is our main reason for choosing this hotel. It was very nice to take our pet with us. Our room was right above the pool and was quite noisy during the night.

However, this is a historic wing - the construction is cement - the rooms are practically sound proof. We did have A/C problems when checking in, but maintanance fixed it immediately.. With hundreds of rooms, hotels will always have problems (nomatter the brand), it's how they deal with them that makes the difference. This hotel obviously has great management from the top down, which reflects in the employees attitudes, the room's spotlessness, and the charm of the hotel. I work for a 5 STAR 5 Diamond international hotel chain, so I'm very picky and am plagued with the hotel inspector evaluation eye (there's a knick on that corner? the edge of the carpet is up? one ring in the shower isn't hooked? call the manager!), but this hotel is well kept and the staff is immaculately professionnal (down to the gift shop employee who doesn't even work for the company). Great Job!</td></tr>

I told them I would rather have floor 7 and immediately they went to work finding a clean room for me to check into. I ended up with 705. It was a beautiful room, close enough to the elevators but not so close that I could hear all the traffic coming off of them. Our room was "river view" and it overlooked the highway and the river. I was nervous because I saw many reviews complaining about the highway noise and I thought it would affect my kids sleeping (they are 3 and 4 years old, and they need their sleep!!), but we all slept very soundly, and thanks to the room darkening blinds, my kids slept all night and didn't get up till 8:30 am!</td></tr>

The sleep experience is even better than at home-time to upgrade my bedding to Belvoir standards again. BTW, I was working in Springfield but choose to stay in the hotel.</td></tr>

Finally, when we were trying to go to sleep but couldn't because our eyes and nose were burning, we tracked down the smell. The people in the next room were either burning incense or smoking something and then burning the incense to cover it up and the smell and probably the smoke was coming through the adjoining door. Even though it was shut and locked we were still getting the smell. While I don't really care what people in the other rooms are doing, I was rather perturbed and upset that the seal between the doors was so bad that whatever my neighbors were doing was keeping me from sleeping. I called to the front desk to complain and I also said something to the front desk when I checked out but they both seemed rather unconcerned that this happened. I don't normally splurge on one of the better hotels when I am just spending one night but I was with my daughter and we wanted to make it a relaxing mother daughter event and I was disappointed that this happened and we had to put up with this.

Among other things no wash cloths, TV went in and out the entire night and the room would not get anywhere close to the 65 that was on the thermostat. Not that I wanted it 65 but 72 would have been good. I guess the part that really got me was the valet. Valet should figure it out. Stack the cars, park them remotely and move them when you can.

She told me that a hot breakfast would not be ready that early in the morning, but if I ordered the basket of muffins and bagel with cream cheese I would receive it at 6am. On the next day, my order was not ready at 6:10am. I called room service and they told me that it was on its way. At 6:15am I called room service back to cancel my order because I had a plane to catch. I was very upset that I had to leave hungry and probably late for my flight.

The only minor issue I had was that because our attendance was so big, our meals had to be outside in the pavilion and on the lawn- which were a bit of a hike from the meeting rooms. The location is great- right near the airport; although you can definitely hear the planes taking off, it's not an overwheming noise. There is an airport shuttle (comfortable and frequent) and a separate shuttle which can take you to the Gaslamp Quarter for $1.</td></tr>

It had not been replaced later that day, so I called to tell them and they said they would get it replaced by that afternoon. Still no coffee pot when we got back to the room in the late pm. So I called again and they finally brough one up. The guy that gave us the room said it had a fantastic view to the resort. Well, if you call the roof of the building fantastic, then I guess it was. Our room keys quick working on the third night and I had to go to the desk to get it fixed but didn't have my id with me, ofcourse. Then had to wait for security and he again asked me for my id.

It made him feel so special. The chefs in the restaurant and the pool staff all joined in to sing to him. It was WONDERFUL. Congratuations on a great remodel I highly recommend this hotel!</td></tr>

I felt that your hotel was extremely ill equipped to handle 100+ teenage football players and their families. 1st day the washer and dryer was broken and not being fixed until the next day. That is a little tough with a bunch of sweaty, smelly football uniforms that are needed the next day. The staff did offer to have uniforms cleaned for us, which was nice. They said it is a little expensive, which I was willing to pay BUT we wouldn't get uniforms back until 6 pm the next day when we had a 1:15 game. We had to go find a laundromat. Staff got me an address of one that was closed down. Not very helpful! There were 4 of us in a room with 4 towels. 2 were football players. I had to call 3 times for more towels since the kids showered a few times a day. 2 of the 3 times I waited for at least an hour to get those towels. Once I was told towels were in the dryer. You guys should have been more prepared for this. Also, how can you start the complimentary breakfast at 7 when a few teams had to be at fields at 7? So I wound up paying the extra $20 for complimentary breakfast and didn't get it. I would love to get a refund for that for the 4 days! Also, one day you started the breakfast earlier and ended earlier without notifying guests. Not fair. If you want to make a guest happy, you will credit me (at least) for the "complimentary" breakfasts and even a little more of a credit would be nice since I had to drive around and find a laundromat since the one given to me by your staff was closed down. Hope you do the right thing to make me feel better about my stay with you.</td></tr>

I have a chronic pain illness and comfort in the bed and coolness in the room were two things that were of utmost importance! We checked in and went to our room which other then being across from the lounge appeared suitable. After sitting in the room for a half hour or so we notice the room was not cooling down as we were both hot from being out in the Texas heat. As night fell the hall became noiser and the 2 and a half to 3 inch gap at the bottom of our door allowed for excessive light and noise in the room.. so much for resting peacefully. The bed was was fairly comfortable although I must say have had more comfortable beds at some ower level hotels then this one which for being a Belvoir and upper class hotel I expected more. The hotel itself was very nice and staff friendly however parking was a nightmare as you pay either an outrageous price to valet park or pay the $12 or $13 dollars a day to park in the garage. There are limited paid parking spots around the hotel which we did find to be free on the weekend!

I rode the elevator back down to the front desk and was instructed some door handles were installed the wrong way and I needed to lift up on the door handle instead of push down. I told the gentleman it seemed as if the door was locked from the top bolt, but he insisted it was an installation problem with the door handle. I rode the elevator back up and tried again unsuccessfully openening the door. This time I took the stairs down 9 flights to again ask for assistance and that we were now going to be late for our opening NYS ceremonies. I told the gentleman again that it seemed to be locked from the inside top latch. He accompanied me to the room and called the technician. It was latched from the inside, but we were also told it jams/sticks to the top bolt. It did indeed stick because many times we were faced with the same situation and literally had to ram the door to get in. Besides the door, we had to wiggle the toilet tank in order for it to fill up with water so we could flush it. It was an inconvenient experience. Not to mention the right elevator would freeze, not open or partially open as well as skip floors when riding in it. :( Disappointed!</td></tr>

However, the service could be improved. We signed up and caught the 6:00 pm shuttle with no problem. We were let off at the visitors center which was a good location. We were given a ticket to use to return on the last shuttle at ~10:00 pm. We arrived well ahead of the 10:00 schedule and waited. Another couple joined us right at 10:00. At 10:20 we called the hotel and were told that the shuttle would be there in 15 minutes that it had been delayed due to a run to the airport. At ~10:45 the shuttle arrived and the driver indicated that the previous driver had told him that there were no passengers for 10:00. We got back in good order but it begs the question, why were we given the ticket and asked to call if we were not going to use the shuttle and then the in house communication indicated that there were no passengers. This disconnect leads to a credibility gap and hurts the hotel's reputation. The drivers were very apologetic and courteous but the inconsistent story marred the experience.</td></tr>

The breakfast buffet had the best view in Poipu. The price was reasonable and the food was delicious. We especially appreciated the friendly omelette maker. Thanks also to staff member Owen who told us about the turtle cove within walking distance of the hotel. He was right we walked to the location and saw about a dozen turtles right near the shore. We had booked through kayak so our bed choice was not guaranteed and we ended up with 2 double beds.They offered to change our room but we were happy with our fourht floor room so did not change.

The clerks insisted that she gave me access and refuse to go to the lounge with me to verity. Finally my card key was replaced but no explanation or apology.</td></tr>

The concierge helped me find things to do when I wasn't at the conference, and the hotel has a shuttle that goes around the city for only $1 per day! The rooms and grounds were very clean. The exercise room is enormous and goes both inside and outside! I noticed they had activities for kids to do at the pool including movies at night on the weekends. The hotel really isn't in walking distance of restaurants, and the hotel's 3 restaurants could get pretty pricey. The food was excellent though, definitely worth the money! My only complaint is that there are no refrigerators in the rooms, but you might be able to ask for one. I didn't ask. I had a great experience and would definitely stay here again.</td></tr>

We were also given access to the club level although we were one floor down, as we are gold members. We arrived late and thought we would take the kids to the pool. The pools were extemely crowded and appeared to have some sort of junior high boys birthday party going on. There were about 15 rowdy boys eating pizza and making a complete mess in the pool area. They also made us feel uncomfortable as if we were ruining their party. I was very surprised that the hotel would allow this in a "business" hotel. We went out and returned hours later in the evening, the party was still going on, and the pool area was trashed. The next day staff had come to put out towels on the chairs and open the pool. The trash still remained all over the tables, pizza boxes and such. It was gross. We never used the pool.</td></tr>

The whole place has been changed (to Rum Fire) and is now completely enclosed (not sure if they open the windows on certain days, though). The breakfast buffet at Rum Fire was also a disappointment--the selection is not what one would expect paying $23 pp (caveat: we only ate there once during our stay).</td></tr>

I think our rooms were given away because of the amount of people there for a competition. They simply overbooked. Other people around us were just as upset as we were and they also had to wait 2 to 3 hrs. Rooms were upgraded and discounted $50. but the upgrade...there was no continental breakfast the next morning, too busy with all the students breakfast with the competition group. When we did get in our room it was dirty and we were looking forward to looking at the view over the city, but the windows in the room were so filthy we couldn't see out of them. The whole place seemed unkept & desperately needs a facelift. We loved the plaza and had a good time. Once of my sisters flew in from N. Carolina & the four of us were looking forward to a nice stay also. Unfortunately the nice stay didn't happen. When shopping on the plaza we told the merchants we brought from about the poor service & not to recommend the Belvoir on the Plaza to anyone. My sisters & I have decided to stay at another hotel in the area next time we are there...just like the couple we talked to who cancelled their room for Sunday night did because of the poor service. Would not accept AARP Card either. At least the doorman and parking attendant were very friendly.........thats the only good thing I can say about the place.</td></tr>

My wife and I had our two little kids, ages 2 and 6 months. I was on a work conference, so I didn't spend much time in our little room, but my wife did. The biggest problem she had was getting the room cleaned in a timely manner. Getting the kids to nap before the room was cleaned was a chore. Also the pool area was infested wiht birds that would steal food right off your tray and dish. It was like a scene out of the movie "The Birds". The staff were very frendly and wanted to help, but we were anxious to get back home.</td></tr>

Very convenient if you have a car and understand LI traffic. The rooms poolside are perfect for my family. We have a three year old and a 10 month old so the less stuff we have to lug around the better. The restaurant is excellent and food is fantastic. My husband have been in the restaurant business for 20+ years Manhattan and San Fran restaurants so we were really impressed. The staff here are SUPER Friendly and accommodating as long as you are nice to them. I have seen some disgraceful behavior by the guests and the staff still treats them with respect. I would have told the guests to take a hike.</td></tr>

Also, our valet experience upon checking out was disappointing. The attendant seemed to want to help pack our car, but when I told him how I wanted it packed, he did not comply with my wishes. I had to unpack everything and repack it. Also, our windows were not washed as advertised. I spent a Suite Nights Reward for the upgraded room, which was not what were were confirmed in.</td></tr>

The bed looked nice but was uncomfortable. The room was small for the high price listed. Aside from the important part which is the room. The staff was great and the hotel was at a great location. I guess parking around downtown are all ridiculous so all said, you might get a better bang for your buck staying a little outside of the downtown area and take public transportation which is a lot cheaper anyhow.</td></tr>
