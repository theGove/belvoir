A number of people came down to get dinner/drinks and watch football. There was only one member on staff and he was clearly overwhelmed. I also ordered the Skirt Steak Chimichurri off of the menu.

Also, It seemed that many people not staying at club level were accessing the lounge and carting away food. The hotel is a very good mid-level choice.

For the most part, the newly hired front desk staff are friendly and courteous; however, if customer service/front desk managers are rude and uncompromising, the front desk staff will think it's okay to treat patrons that way.

So the room was very hot the whole time I was getting ready, which was a pain. Once I got back to the room later that night, it was a pleasant temperature b/c the A/C had been on. Some of these ""green"" measures are just plain silly and more of a nuisance than they were worth. Also the hallways of the hotel were very warm, which wasn't pleasant, and smelled like curry. The hotel is beautiful overall and well maintained. I would recommend changing the air conditioning system though. We ordered room service for breakfast the next morning and while everything was delicious, the portions were TINY. I got huevos rancheros and I think there were two tablespoons of black beans on the plate. If the hotel is going to charge room service prices, at least make the portions decent. Also, the hotel front desk staff wasn't very friendly and didn't seem anxious to get my room for me even though it was a VIP room."

The Front Desk area was loud and I could barely hear the woman who checked me in, due to excessive noise. I was put in a room on the 3rd floor and attached to a meeting room. The bathroom was dingy, paint peeling by the ceiling, with no washcloths. There was a broken thermostat on the wall and the room was too hot. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the only worthwhile aspect of the room. The wi-fi was additional fee and slow. I could hear people in the hallway, as if they were inside my room.

So I was tired and perhaps not very tolerant. Nevertheless, I was dismayed to find, after I had returned my rental car, that the hotel does not offer a shuttle service to and from the airport. The additional $45 for a taxi each way seemed like a significant extra expense I had not anticipated. Further, I found the room, though with ample space, to be poorly lit and with a fairly antiquated air conditioning system. There was someone else's hair on the bedroom vanity. The bathroom was small with only a standard residential bathtub (with a drain plug that would not stay open for the use of the shower). The decor of the room seemed outdated to me. When I called to report that I could not access my room because my key cards would not work, I was placed on hold, after which I was told someone would come to help me. When this person arrived, he tested my keycards himself (as if I was mistaken), then asked to see my identification before opening my door for me. He then said that I would have to take my keycards back down to the front desk to have them fixed. I agreed to the terms and fee to access the wireless internet but after returning from having the keycards fixed, the internet was no longer available. I called for help and was transferred to tech support where I was on hold for about 10 minutes. As soon as someone came on the line, the internet modem showed up and I was able to log back on. I made 4 calls from my room to toll-free numbers, yet I was charged $2.29 for each of these toll-free calls. Perhaps because I was there over a Saturday night, at some time of the early evening, music could be heard in my room, coming from the courtyard side. I do not know the source."

Also, ordered room service and after waiting 45 minutes I called back to be told that they forgot to get my name and room number so they did not cook it and the kitchen was now closed. The next morning I called to order coffee and the lady told me what room I was in and my last name and when I asked her how she knew she told me that name and room always show when you call room service and front desk. So, not too sure how the person the night before could claim they couldn't cook our food because they did not know what room or name. The only reason we stay here is because it is very convenient when going to the rangers games.(walking distance) However, the rooms are over priced and so is the food.

I looked at the AC Filter and saw that it was filthy, it looked as though it had not been changed in months. I called downstairs to ask for the manager to come up and take a look. She came up stairs with the Director of Maintenance who stated that they keep a record book and that it was changed recently. I stated that if it was changed recently then you have got huge problems with dirt and dust in this hotel because a filter does not get that dirty in a matter of a couple of months. It was so bad you could not even see through the filter when held up to the light. Anyway, they change the filter and dont offer me anything. So next I get settled and unpacked and try to use the internet, to my surprise the internet was not working. I called downstairs and was told they would call the technician to see what was going on. About 1 hour later still not working, just in my room, rest of the hotel was ok. So, they move me to another room. Now I have to get all of my belongings together and make the move. We check the internet and its ok. I get settled again, go to dinner come back and try to use the TV, the remote control does not work. I call back downstairs and they send a maintenance man up. He changes the batteries in the remote, then changes remotes all together. Now it works but you have to push the up down button at least twice to change the channel and same thing with the volume. We go back and forth with this and finally I had enough and tell him to leave, I will deal with it. I go to lie down in bed and now the remote will not work at all. The maintenance man comes back up and he gets it to work but he is standing up right in front of the TV. I tell him that it should work from lying down. He states to me no, thats the way it works. I must get up out of bed, stand in front of the TV to change the channel anytime I want to change the channel. This is now very comical, if this was not happening to me I would not belive it. The maintenance man actually said, You need to get up, stand in front of the TV every time you want to change the channel or move the volume I kid you not. I had enough of this guy, so I call downstairs and speak to a front desk clerk; I ask her does she think that I should have to do this every time I need to change the channel. She actually states to me sir, if thats what maintenance says then thats what you need to do I ask her, yes I know what they said but Im asking you does this sound right. She states yes. I have to give it to them, they all stick together, no matter how stupid they are."

However, there were a few problems with this hotel we hadn't encountered before. The first, the parking area is being used as a parking lot for off of property events. The area was coned so you had to drive behind the hotel (past the trash, etc...) to get to the front. Also the parking behind the hotel was so hap-hazard, we had to weave around parked cars to get through. Upon entering the lobby, there was a water dispenser (as it was 108 degress that day.) At 3PM, the dispenser was empty. At check in, we informed the lobby staff and they said they would take care of it. As we left for dinner at 6PM, the dispenser was still empty, the sliced orange still stuck in the same place on the side of the glass container. We stayed on the 5th floor and as we walked to our room, we couldn't notice how dirty the carpets were, you could see the paths to each of the doorways. Also there were scuff marks almost the entire length of the walls from either the maid carts or baggage carts being dragged along them. Finally upon checkout, we were unable to exit the driveway due to the parking lot issue. The exit gate was closed and the attendant told use to use our room key. When we told him we had just checked out and showed him our parking pass, we were told we had to go back to the front desk and get a card so we could exit. Upon returning to the front desk, they told me I had the parking pass and the parking attendant should have let us out. We returned to the gate and waited until the attendant returned who then let us out without an apology. Even with these issues the hotel room was clean and comfortable which is most important. We did bring these issues to the attention of the staff who responded with an ""ok."" This is a new hotel that gives the look of a much older property..."

Cleaniness was a little off here and there...for instance, the first day/night, my floor was sticky in the entryway (not sure if it was from cleaning product or just dirty) and there was a cup/mug ring on the dresser. Morning came and I wanted to make myself a coffee, opened the machine to start the heating, and the stagnant water it began to boil filled my room with the smell of mildew for a day and a half or more; no idea how long the water had been in there prior to my arrival. I had housekeeping remove it, but I never got a replacement. This is the only 'bad' customer service I received in the hotel.

When we arrived (on Friday am), we discovered (as others have said) its next to impossible to secure a room upgrade (NB As a Platinum BPG member, this is the first time I have not been upgraded in 2 + years). The action in the bar also explains why the elevators are so slow (we waited for 10 minutes on two occasions on Saturday). Its because the hotel dedicates 2 of its elevators to the bar, including the service elevator, forcing its own staff to use the public lifts! Housekeeping was pretty iffy - we had to ask for everything! The staffing in the BPG lounge was spotty - they opened late & were inattentive when supplies ran out!

Our room had a sink that backed up so bad I can not believe that a house keeper cleaning the sink would not have seen this. In addition our toilet backed up and we had to have maintenance work on the toilet 3 different times. I don't believe this is reflective of the majority of Shearton properties I have stayed at over the years but of a reflection of poor attention to detail and a definite lack of accountability. I believe your management needs to pay attention to visible details and hold staffs accountable. In addition I found the dining room menue to be very poor in terms of options. As a result we only had one meal on property in five days. Lastly each morning the maids meet at there supply room to gather their things for the day. However the amount of noise and commotion taking place in this room and in the immediate hallway needs to be stopped. At times it was like a mini convention holding a political rally, noisy and conjusted. I suggest more time be spent cleaning hall ways, doors and walls with finger prints on them and picking up room service dishes that are left in the hallways for a day or more. Bottom line I was very disappointed in our stay at your property."

The rooms were very well kept and clean. We liked having lots of pillows, the complimentary water was a fabulous unexpected amenity and the staff was very helpful. Our first night we realized we had a leak in the bathroom causing a small puddle. We are pretty easy so we just called the front desk to alert them and said it was fine to us as long as it didn't get worse but just wanted them to know. They sent maintenance right away. He brought us extra towels for the floor and told us he would have it fixed first thing in the morning, which he did. The front desk was always pleasant as were the valets and porters. My son ended up with a collection of stuffed animals from Disneyland and the housekeepers would always arrange them nicely on his bed for him. He enjoyed that. Overall, it was a great hotel and experience. We chose to walk to Disneyland every day which was about 10-15 minutes depending on crowd and crosswalk lights. We could also walk to Garden Walk for dinner. We never used the ART but the hotel hasa nice sitting area for it to stop at right out front. The laundry room was great to have, although, it took us almost 3 hours to do a load because we had to run the dryer twice to get clothes fully dry. That was a bummer to have to sit there that long with nothing to do. Finally, the snack shop was a great option although pricey.

What did I get for the Resort Fee? NOTHING that I know of. Valet Parking - yes my car was parked and I got two bottles of ice cold water when we checked out. Neither of which I think is worth $15 when the parking lot was within steps of the front door. Had I known this I would have parked my car myself. I loved the hotel and the renovation is superb, but I may have to think twice about staying myself and putting my groups at the hotel. I am a tour operator and was looking for some new hotels in the Orlando area.

I went back to the front desk to request an upgrade but was quickly told that none were available. It was as if I was lucky to get any room at all (even though I made the reservation over a month prior), but was offered no explanation. Access to the very nice Club Lounge was included. However, my one glass of wine was not. The computer in the lounge was down and after standing and waiting to be charged, the attendant finally gave up and said he would call me later to verify the exact amount, which he did.

Also, upgrade to rooms in buildings near beach and pool.",3,"A bit deceiving from online site...however, great location","They advertise recently renovated, however, they fail to mention that there are many buildings within the Belvoir Kauai and not all have been renovated and if they have, I'm sure they spent more money on the main building which houses the pool, restaurants/bar. If your in the other buildings it's as if you're an outcast with your own pool that has no food or beverage options. They also advertise the Rainforest Spa. The spa doesn't exist. I found this out after the front desk sent me looking for the ""spa"" in my building and after searching around I asked the Salon staff and found out the spa was actually in a hotel room - the one below my room. The pillows were flat and uncomfortable and the bathroom was extremely dim. The shower also had no water pressure (an issue I heard among many guests). We also were put in a room that had no towels and were told it would be a few hours to get them (another issue shared among guests) In the rooms we had no cell service and terrible wifi. Most of the time you loose connection. As far as food - in the book of guest services it states that breakfast is from 7:30-10:30am (pretty early considering the times of all other hotels) - found out the hard way that they changed their hours to 7:30am-9:30am - even worse and we missed breakfast. When we finally made it to Rum Fire for breakfast the next day it was a good 15 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink...another 15 minutes before we got our coffee and juice. And, much later before we got our food. Needless to say, we did not go there for dinner due to terrible service. Luckily, we found The Shops at Kukui ula and stumbled upon amazing food places for a quarter of the prices at the Belvoir. The location of the actual main pool on the beach was beautiful. Due to the lack of amenities (spa, room service -which doesn't serve breakfast fyi) I would not stay there again. We were on our honeymoon and expected to relax in a spa, not have to rush out for breakfast and were very disappointed."

The fitted sheet was half off the bed and the pillows were all ove r the floor and chair.That was phone call #1 to guest servics. Phone call #2 came after realizing that the sink was clogged. There is no way housekeeping could have cleaned it and left it that way. Very disappointed. I also noticed that there was visible dirt on the floor and it did not appear to have been vacuumed. I didn't even bother to call about the floor . It was late and I wanted to get dinner and go to bed. I just made sure to kep my feet covered.

I had to call the front desk on two occasions, once at 12:30am. They should be aware of the volume of the lobby music - especially at that time of the night. The other nights I just dealt with it - I only called the nights where the noise kept me awake. Other than that, everything was fine. I choose Belvoir so I can count on a good night's sleep. This was an anomaly and if I return to this location, I will know what to ask for next time!"

However, the morning of our check-out, housekeeping came knocking at our door at 9:45am, before we could answer the door, the male housekeeper had the door open and was standing there looking at us. Just out of the shower and not fully dressed. Check out time is at 12:00 noon and I dont think housekeeping should be knocking on doors and intruding on guests before then. Prior to this we could hear them knocking on other guests doors and talking loudly in the hall, as we were trying to sleep. We finally decided that sleeping in was not an option. We were on the 6th floor, club level and you think they would have been more courteous. We felt like the whole floor was being kicked out as they were knocking on all the doors and opening them, hours before check out. Other than that, our stay was great and the room was very cozy.

If the hotel new that they had an oversold situation that they would give preferance to BPG members or at least contact to us that rooms are not available. I would certainly not recommend this hotel until they finish their renovation and maybe their service will improve"

Woke up around 12 am freezing still. Called the front desk with no answer. Woke up every hour I would say cold and uncomfortable. Called the front desk again around 830 just ready to get out of here with no shower obviously I know this room was around 50 degrees. Was offered $25 refunded or free breakfast. I asked for the corporate number and called them . I've yet to hear from them three days later . The hotel called back and offered $25 more back. I was still I satisfied and he took off another $25 and says he sent me an email for a future stay which I have not received. So in the end I paid $80 for a room with no heat still not happy. If anyone knew at checking they were paying even $80 for a room with no heat they wouldn't checkin. Very unhappy with the customer service.

After my sister checked in, the cleaning lady came to the room and said that they had checked out. The bride arrived to check into her bridal suite and the staff had the gull to tell her they didnt have a room for her. She waited an hour in the lobby with her hair and makeup done and dress in-tow. Check-out was no different. They didn't have any dollies available. I asked a doorman if I could use the one he was unloading afterwards, and he accepted. When he finished he went back on his word and went upstairs with it, no doubt in order to receive a tip from someone. So our check-out took an extra hour since we had 3 suitcases, 2 bathroom bags, toy bags, diaper bag, 2 pack n plays (cause they didnt give us the cribs we reserved, thank heaven we packed those), and several items. You might as well not make a reservation because whatever you reserve, you wont get it. Oh yah, also not a good place to go for quietness.

First at check the lady was cold and unwelcoming. Once we got to our room later that night we opened the door and stepped into the dark room. The ottoman was in the entryway and I almost broke my neck tripping over it (the chair it goes to was on the other side of the room. No reason for it be where it was except pure laziness). Once I got into the room I turned the air down (that had to be the most complicated thermostat I have ever used.) I went to the bathroom to take a shower since we had been at the fair all day. I walk in to find no shampoo, no soap, and the worst thing was a half USED bottle of mouthwash. I called downstairs to get some toiletries sent up. It took calling 4 times and listening to the ring for 15 min. before someone finally answered in a rude tone. I requested the items and she said she would have house keeping bring them up. Almost 2 hours later I finally hear a knock on the door. When voicing my complaints to the service desk upon checkout I was comped parking. Sure glad they saved me that few bucks."

We were very happy with the location...only a few blocks from Independence Mall. It is in a quieter area than some of the other conveniently located hotels, too, which we found pleasant. The gentleman who checked us in at the desk gets an A++ for professionalism, friendliness, and great service. We found the rest of the staff good too. Rooms looked very clean. I had wished there was a small fridge or microwave in the room for convenience, but the way things worked out the lack of these amenities wasn't much of an issue. I absolutely love that the property is 100% smoke free - getting stuck in a smoking room is a deal breaker for us and when all rooms are nonsmoking you don't have to worry about that happening. There was a wedding one night we were there and it was noisy...the walls seem not very soundproof and we could hear not only the wedding music into the night but clearly heard conversations of the people in the next room, but this was not enough of an issue that it would deter us staying again in the future. Overall, very happy with our choice to stay here. All properties near the historic district are expensive but this wasn't any worse than others in the area with the special they were offering. If an affordable room was available on our next trip we would stay here again in a heartbeat.

I again presented it to the front desk clerk on the morning of departure. On the day of check out the original fee document was presented to the desk clerk who read it and then referred us to the valet area. The charge was finally corrected after we checked out but it took us two days working with multiple people who talked the talk but did not walk the walk. Very irritating!

Love this location in Poipu. Staff is very friendly, especially valet team. Bags delivered to room immediately. The problem - and it is a big one: this hotel is WAY over due for a renovation. I've stayed twice in the last 5 years and both times was disgusted by the condition of the room. Battled ants in 2008 and last week - what appeared to be tiny roaches? Mattresses are old, carpet is stained and filthy. The bathroom walls have not been wiped down in DECADES. And the grout in the tub/shower area is nearly black with grime. The room smells old and musty. I thought my experience in 2008 was a fluke - I now know this is just the condition of this sub-standard facility. It's really a shame because the beach location is wonderful. One shouldn't have to feel like they need a shower after stepping out of the hotel shower. I would be embarrassed to recommend this location to anyone (without a huge warning/disclaimer about the rooms). For this reason, I won't return until they renovate.

Megan than pulled the reciept and asked for something with my signature on it which I provided my driver's license, and two other items with my signature. It was quite obvisous it was not my signature however she spent at least 3 to 5 minutes doing a handwriting analyasis at which time I told just charge me for the $17 as she is was questioning my interigity. She than hestatily stated she would remove the charge. The second issue was with the valet parking. I was charged for two cars and and only had one. She questioned this too. The impression I got from her was she was not there to help but question everything I brought up. After about 10 minutes they were able to get the bill right.

I was counting on a stress free stay since we had so much stress from the wedding already. From the moment of check-in, however, our stay was anything but stress-free. There was only one cart available when we unloaded so we had to wait a few minutes for one to be available to us. Then at the desk, we were less than an hour before rehearsal and they would not let me check in because the reservation was under my husband's name, even though I called twice before to confirm that there would be no issue. The gentleman at the front desk offered no options or help of any kind, which made me even more upset. Finally we were able to get up to our room and when we did, there was a soaking wet towel in the bathtub. Housekeeping did come up to take care of it right away. The elevators were incredibly slow. We waited at least 5 minutes each time, even though there are 3 elevators. Then on check out, there was a waiting list for luggage carts so we ended up taking our belongings, including my wedding dress and steamer, down in a few loads to the car. Positives: the food from room service wasn't bad and the bed was comfortable. There was no mini-fridge, which was disappointing, and the room we stayed in was pretty worn. On our previous stay, the room was much nicer. I would recommend the hotel for one reason, the location. You can't beat it but I wouldn't pay for this hotel if it wasn't where it is."

Even the manager didn't seem to know how to handle situations. Several of us had to come back to the desk, because the rooms we were given were not what we reserved or agreed to receive. This has happened to me for the past 3 years in a row. The manager tried to joke and rush to action before even comprehending my concern. Finally, however, he did get it right, but it took over 30 minutes. Next, valet completely bent my license plate. After calling it to their attention, they tried to say that it was not them. However, the plate was not bent when I first left my vehicle with valet services. They attempted to straighten it back out, but it is still slightly bent. Breakfast this year was very subpar what I'm used to having at the Belvoir. So much so, that I refused to do dinner there as my family and I usually do. There were no apologies and no show of concern for any of the issuesI I encountered. It is absolutely sad that our universities keep putting us at an establishment that doesn't seem to care about showing common courtesy, respect and proper professionalism."
