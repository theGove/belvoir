When I got to my room I found that my pillow case was dirty the first and then didn't get changed the for second night. I could not enjoy a bath because the tub had a stain ( the newly remodeled room). The second night I was there I had to call house keeping to come change my sheets and no one was sent up. That same night I waited in the DRAFT to place a togo order and had to ask someone to wait on me.

I have reserved two rooms in this Hotel, two weeks before our arrival to see the Miami game with the following (two connected rooms one with King Bed and the other room with two queen-sized bed for our friends children. On the day of our arrival in Miami around noon I called the hotel to let them know that we will be checking in by 4:00pm, the staff that answered the phone assured me that the two rooms weve reserved are ready and will be waiting for us. But then, when we got there, a lady from the registration desk told us that only one room is ready and that the second room (connected to one room) should soon be ready so she gave us the keys for only one room. After about 30 minutes I called the front desk to see if the second room is ready, another lady talked to me with a different tone on her voice and said the room will not be ready for another 30 to 45 minutes, I was very unsatisfied at that moment so I asked her why then she said there is nothing she can do the guest that was staying on that room had checked out late so their just starting to clean the room. After 20 minutes my husband came out the room and so the cleaning lady just got done cleaning it so my friend went downstairs, and a guy said that the room is not ready and it should be ready by the time we get back from the game so she went back to the room .Ive asked my husband to come with me down the front desk to talk to a manager about the whole thing. When we asked for a manager a Supervisor offered to talk to us and shell try to help us she said. We told her exactly what was happening and that we are very dissatisfied of all the staff that we talked to she apologized and asked us what she could do to ease our disappointment so we asked her to find if the room is ready and that because of all the delay that we should also have a late check out. She asked us what time we want to check out and we said 6:00pm if thats possible she said yes and she also said the room is ready but, there are no 2 queen beds in any of the rooms, but they can and will provide us a bed (a folding bed which by the way, my friends back ached so bad the next day). So that was the end of our first day, The next day on our way to eat breakfast, I went to front desk just to make sure that we are checking out at 6:00pm, what a surprise when the lady I was talking said it was not entered into the system at all, that if we had checked out at six they would charge us a full day extra. Thank God I went back to check before it was too late. So everything is set, we went out,came back around 5pm , guess what? We were locked out! Our keys were not reprogrammed to check out by 6pm so my husband went down to the front desk wanted to talk to the manager once and for all. But the lady he was talking to giving him more excuses for what happened instead of calling the manager so my husband just had enough , he just asked the keys to be reprogrammed. Overall, we had a great time in Miami except for the services that weve had from this hotel and made us all feel not to come and check in to any Belvoir hotel ever.</td></tr>

Never heard any construction noise or other quests for that matter, very quiet and relaxing. The views were beautiful and stretch as far as the eye can see. The parking is pricey at almost 37 a night but you can take your car out and bring it back as much as you want no extra charge. It also doesn't hurt that they have one of 3 starbucks in town, downstairs open 9am to 5pm daily. Oh and that their in room coffee is also starbucks, hats off guys!

When I took a shower in the morning, the tub was very slow draining and in my brief shower, about an inch and a half of standing water accumulated. I mentioned this to the front desk when checking out, so another guest did not have the same experience and was apologized to and offered a meager apology with some BPG points.

The same was on the light fixture itself and in the connecting room bathroom to ours.(I took pictures) After waiting 2 hours for housekeeping to help us with remaking a bed that our child had been sick in we had to call again. Felt that was a bit long to wait. Also parking was an issue. There were events at the hotel 2 of the 3 nights we were there. We were told we could only park in 1 parking lot as the other was reserved for the events. After paying$22 per day to park we felt that we were not as valued as the patrons who only needed parking for the evening. With a small child and an infant, parking in the dirt parking lot quite a distance away was an inconvenience. Other than these issues it is a great hotel with a beautiful view.</td></tr>

Thus, if you are assigned a room on the Grandbourne Guest floor at the very top of the hotel, the rooms can be too warm to be comfortable. On the other hand, the pool does not seem to be heated, I never saw anyone swim in it, just sit on the sides dangling their feet in the water. My spouse reported that it felt like ice water. I saw quite a few young people who appeared to be very disappointed. It's also annoying that , even if you are a disabled person, and are not feeling well, you still have to personally check in at the front desk. The rooms have pull out sofas, but the hotel doesn't put sheets or blankets on them, you have to call to get sheets delivered to your room. We got a 2 p.m. checkout, they would not give us 4 pm, and even then the maid kept pestering us, even with the "do not disturb" sign on the door.

We stayed one week and the room was clean and all staff so friendly. The valet Curtis noticed a scrape on my car that I hadn't gotten fixed, and got some polish out and buffed it out. Amazing. Great service, the building has interesting history and great location. Nice gym, and we had a business meeting in the lounge with great service. I did not like the cabana rooms, they are tired... the tower was better. Thanks!</td></tr>

If you go to the ticket and attractions desk they make you go to other desk first. Then that desk just hands you a simple price sheet and has you go back to the first desk you were at. Then the second desk will eventually get to you and just read you what is on the sheet you got with no real help. Then if you ask for something special you have to go back to the other desk.

When I arrived at the front desk I wasn't even apologized to or asked if they could do anything to make this situation better. We arrived at our second room which was much better. The service was less than good and then upon going to our meeting for the explore package we had instead of 1 hour it took 3 hours to tell the person NO!! He asked what we liked and disliked about the first time we meet with someone and we told her the pressure selling they do. Then he asked how our stay was so far and I told him about how terrible the customer service was setting up the trip and then we were checked into a dirty room. Miguel said that he would take care of us and make sure they didn't something for all the hassel. After the long three hours of us saying NO we aren't going to buy Miguel was mad and left and did nothing for us in regards to the problems we had just as I told my husband he would. This property isn't the property to stay at for the average Joe because they only really give the good customer service to the Grandbourne OWNERS!!! And don't eat at their resteraunts they are DISGUSTING like canned and boxed food and in Zimmy's two of the servers were clearly arguing right out in front of everyone in the dining room and for a disgusting meal it cost us $70 and we had to deal with the arguing!!!

The weird thing is, I've brought the issues up more than once to no avail. For instance, I've stayed there the past two weeks. Out of 7 days, I received a newspaper at my room once. And, the gift shop where you can buy necessities, which is operated by a contractor, may just be closed for a solid hour during its normal operating hours. It was last Thursday from about 8:10pm. And then there was the bizarre incident two weeks back when I could not get hold of room service or guest services for at least 30 minutes. No matter what phone button I pushed, I was forwarded to my voicemail. (I had no messages.) Essentially, the hotel's 2nd and 3rd shifts seem to have a poor sense of customer service, while the day crew is much better. One other disappointment - the hotel's concierge club is permanently shut down and closed off. Pathetic.</td></tr>

We have always had wonderful stays up until this point. We checked in and everything seemed fine. We went to bed after traveling a long day and we were awakened by a cell phone which was left under the bed around midnight. Then my dogs were up and awake, four hours later we were awakened by the walls viberating and making a really loud noise. This continued until we left the room on and off every 15 mins or so till 10am. We then gave up on sleeping and dealing with the dogs growling at 7am and decided to shower. We then had very hot- to freezing temp water in the shower, the temp changed alot for me and my husband then showered and his shower was freezing the entire time. We called and spoke with a girl and she said she would get us a room change as soon as she can figure out a room for us to move to. We waited for a phone call back about a room being ready and never got one. So when we left the room for the day we stopped at the front desk to speak with someone and a manager I think said when we came back later that evening he would have a room ready for us, and would give 2000 rewards points in addition to our stay for the inconvience. This was fine I understand problems happen and that would be fine if they fixed the issue. We then came back at the end of the day around 9pm and there was no room ready so we stood in the lobby waiting to move. No notes in the system to move us, or of the issue, or anything. We finally got another room, went to get our things to move to the next room and got in to bed. We made it to 9am before the noise started in this room so that was good, but the shower was still terrible. I did not enjoy a second cold shower. I called the guest service and they told me they would have a manager call me back within 30 mins. No one called me back and I was there till 12. I also had the note on the door saying quiet and I had a housekeeper try to come into the room from 10am on till I left. This wouldnt be that bad if I didnt have my dogs going crazy every time she tried to open the door. Wuth check out being noon it was a little annoying. I am just unhappy with the price and having to move and not having a manager care enough to even talk to us.</td></tr>

Well that simple nights stay was a bit less than simple. Firstly the room location was out of the way up a few stairs and a bit confusing as to its location not being part of the tower. Upon entering the room, the toilet was running, simple enough just jiggle the handle and it stopped. The internet wasn't nearly a strong enough signal for what it cost. It took nearly 15 minutes of trying to connect to the network before giving up and using a smartphone. On a side note, in this day and age many of your competitors offer wi-fi free of charge for their guests. The coffee machine was difficult to turn on requiring quite a bit of force to turn on. In addition to the force required to turn on the coffee maker one had to also brace the machine to prevent it from being knocked over by the force to turn in on. this is both dangerous and unneeded in my opinion.</td></tr>

I've been on other club floors where they had something "hot" like bacon and eggs. Here they only had cereals, muffins and fruit. Their evening snacks were very nice- hot meatballs, poppers, chicken kabobs, etc. (2 different ones every night). Our third night here we switched to a suite because we were excpeting another person and needed more room. I called down to request a rollaway in the suite. They called me back a few minutes later and told me they only give rollaways to the suites. I had to tell them that I was in a suite. I'm not sure why they didn't already know this! Then a few minutes later they called me back and told me they had no rollaways available and offered to send up extra blankets instead. Then later that night the front dest called me and asked me if I got my rollaway. I had to inform them that they told me they had none. So, they were a little disjointed on communication between the front desk and the service people. We had upgrated to the suite for the rollaway and then didn't get one. So we were alittle squichy on the beds that night. Other than that the beds were comfortable.</td></tr>

What a lovely hotel with plenty of room for a family of 5. The room had two double beds and a nice pull out sectional that fit us well. Really loved having the mini fridge in the room for drinks and snacks. The grounds are beautiful and my kids loved chasing lizards around the grounds. The staff was very nice. One day they even brought popsicles out to all the kids (and adults) at the pool. Speaking of the pool. What a great place for our three kids to swim while we could catch the basketball scores and have a nice cocktail poolside. The concierge had a long list of recommended activities and restaurants that we took use of. The hotel is on the beach and the Hawaiian ice truck across the street is not to be missed. We were glad we had our car to go to the main part of the city in the evenings. We found parking very easy and the two times we paid was cheap. I think trying to use the shuttle with 5 people would have been hard. We all had a blast - my kids are 3, 7, and 9 and they LOVED Key West. The hotel was a great place for us. Would highly recommend this trip and this hotel. It was perfect for our family.</td></tr>

You need to walk out of the bathroom to wash your hands or groom yourself. Uncomfortable if you were sharing a room. Balcony is tiny.and there is no view. The air conditioner is so loud it keeps you from sleeping. Almost as loud as a washing machine. Room was clean and beds comfortable. Coffee and water there every day. Be aware of the daily $10 surcharge and $10 parking fee. These are not negotiable and should be considered when getting a rate. Close to all shopping and restaurants as well as relatively close to Disney. Hotel was average and not what i had hoped from Belvoir.</td></tr>

As for the Internet, I have never had service that was so reliable and easy to connect to, even on the 10th floor--and I travel quite a bit for both business and recreation.

My bridesmaids and I were then floors apart from each other and were all forced to sleep in one bed (since the air mattress provided to us, after we requested it, was 'left over' from a previous guest - according to the attendant. Who knows where that had been!) I also noticed that outlet covers were falling off the outlets in our rooms. The rooms were very cramped and were certainly not worth the exceedingly expensive rate. Though we were given 'breakfast' at a special lounge in the hotel, the breakfast was lack-luster. There were slimy-looking pieces of fruit, coffee, and maybe two pastries. The expresso machine was broken and the attendant made no effort to fix it. Finally, the Belvoir did not validate, or even discount, our very expensive parking. We will never go back again. Very hard to come up with anything good to say about this hotel.</td></tr>

The party then moved to the room next to mine...it was extremely loud...the walls must be paper thin. The party noise finally stopped at 4am...just in time for us to wake up at 4:30 am...a well rested 30 minute slumber! This was by far the worst experience I've had at a Grandbourne property.

Food was delicious in the restaurant also. Will definitely stay here if room available on next visit. Thank you to all the staff who made this visit so enjoyable.</td></tr>

Is this how you treat your Preferred Guests? What does "Preferred" mean to you? When I checked in on a seperate reservation 2 days earlier, I informed the desk clerk that I would be arriving late (12:30 AM), and she noted it in my reservation. The last thing I want to have to do at that time of day is pack up my belongings again, and move to another hotel. I work for the airlines, and while I understand the rationale behind overbooking, I also know that our high level frequent fliers are accomodated when an overbooking occurs. This will definitely factor into my decision on whom to give my business in the years ahead.</td></tr>

I have stayed at all 4 of the Grandbourne properties several times each (this hotel probably 20 plus times) I have been around for the renovations etc.. over the past 3-4 years and while the renovtions have made the property great (especially for younger kids) since the renovations I have been very disapointed with the service. In November the service was so bad that we even checked out a cuple of days early from the hotel in frustration. When booking the family coming over in March, the kids really wanted to go to that pool, so I said we would give it one more chance. We were also using points to stay so my expectations were very low as to the service/room etc... we would get. I have to say, I think customer service has been a point or training for the folks over at Belvoir Waikiki. I was thoroughly impressed with the staff from Front desk, to housekeeping, to the lounge, to the pool area. Everyone gave my family the respect and service level one would expect in such a hotel. Thanks!</td></tr>

This is not to say that the other employees were not firendly and accommodating. This employee was "NICOLE" she has only been with you for a couple of years but it appeared from her knowledge, and willingness to give us information was second to none. Her smile was infectious. Great work from Nicole.</td></tr>
