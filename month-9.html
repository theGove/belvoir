The pool was so cold you couldn't even get in and it was dirty too! This AFTER we waited over an hour for the maintenance guy to fix the door so we could actually get into the pool area. I had to call the front desk twice to get that done!! The bathtub in the room had stains that I could not remove after trying to clean it myself. For what we paid for this room for one night, they did not even offer a continental breakfast yet the rude front desk guy informed me I could purchase breakfast (for a ridiculous price per person) in the hotel restaurant. We were already paying above what was reasonable for that level of quality and to not offer breakfast is ridiculous!!! The room has two air vents in the ENTIRE room and the air goes on and off which is very frustrating...the room remained hot and never felt comfortable (yet the air was working properly) no matter how low we turn it down. The guy at the front desk was on a personal call when I walked up one time to ask a question and actually rolled his eyes and stated "what do you need?!" Ummm...this was the worst experience we have ever had a hotel and considering the cost of the whole thing I would NEVER stay here again!! We checked out other hotels in the area (due to having to return to the area in a couple months) and would stay at those over this hotel in a heartbeat!!! This hotels offer either continental breakfasts or breakfast buffets at their restaurants at a way lower price than this place, Take my advice....BOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!</td></tr>

The hallways were not vacuumed during our entire stay and were filthy.

My most recent stay was a terrible exception. The hotel is under renovation and the staff clearly was not prepared to handle the problems renovations can bring. The day I was there, some sort of housekeeping problem prevented rooms from being ready at check in. The staff did not handle the situation well at all. I was repeatedly told my room would be ready in an hour and when I returned to the registration desk, I would stand in line for 20-30 minutes with other angry guests only to be told it would be another hour. I watched while one guest after another left the registration desk in frustration. What added to the frustration was the nonchalant attitude the staff seemed to have. They seemed completely unconcerned that guests could not get into their rooms even though check in time had long passed. I finally had to leave for a 7:00 dinner reservation and on the way to the restaurant I received a call indicating my rooms were ready. I had specifically reserved 2 rooms with 2 beds each and asked them to be sure to hold those as I had 5 people in my party, including adults who did not want to share a bed. By the time we returned from dinner they had given one of the rooms away and only had a king room available. After a conversation with the manager and several trips to various rooms (none of which had 2 beds), I finally gave up and took a king room. By this time it was 10:30 PM. The manager was apologetic, but clearly unequipped to address the situation. He offered no compensation, so I took it upon myself to suggest that he comp one of the rooms. He agreed to do so, but the fact that I had to ask after having arrived at the hotel at 2:30 and not getting into my room (and the wrong one at that) until 10:30 PM was ridiculous. Grandbourne typically provides a high level of customer service. This was not the case at all the Belvoir New Orleans. I would not recommend staying here until all the renovations are complete.</td></tr>

The bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water, two features that can often make or break our stay. The location while not where we usually stay was a good choice. The Top of the Hub with its spectacular view and reasonably priced wine and appetizers was a big hit.. If you are staying at the Belvoir I would recommned it as a must see.</td></tr>

I returned to my room after my first day of meetings around 6 to find that the room had not been touched. I know there is a program to receive more points if your room is not cleaned but I did not put out the card to participate. I called the front desk (dialing 0 as the quick call buttons on the phones in the room do not work). The response I received was "your room was missed, that happens sometimes". Neither apology nor even any apparent concern that this would be a problem. I told the agent that this was not the level of service I expected and suggested it may be time for me to stay somewhere else. The response was I'm sorry to hear that. I would have expected at least some effort to keep a customer and resolve an issue. The agent finally did offer to send someone up to the room and that did happen quickly and the room was cleaned. I don't mind having issues when I travel but I do expect the hotel to have some accountability and concern over missed service and make some attempt to keep my business. If the housekeeping staff at the hotel does regularly miss rooms and the management does not think this is a problem then they will be losing more business than just mine. I have a lot of hotel options in the Bellevue area and for my next trip I will staying at a different hotel.</td></tr>

They used to house a Shula's here and many of the restaurant staff remember those recipes! Craft beers also. Terrific location nearly right on top of St. John Towne Center for nearly everything you can think of for food and reasonable shopping too. Very close to Univ. North Florida.

But we had 2 issues: one had to do with the cleanliness of the room. There was a pill under the desk and a hair in the bathtub. The other issue was that when we returned late at night, the parking lot was completely full except for the spots all the way in the back. We had accessed our room through the conference center earlier, but those doors were locked. We did not see any other entrances and had to walk all the way around to the front lobby. We later found out there were side entrances near the front, but we could not see them. The staff did add BPG points to our account because of the cleanliness issue, which we were satisfied with. We will stay there again, without question.</td></tr>

I finally had a room at 9pm. The shower was gross and the drain was slow, leaving you to stand in a pool of water when showering. Nothing spectacular about the room. It was very warm and stuffy. The air conditioner was not working well. Although it's a smoke free hotel, as soon as you walk out the door, there were consistently a line of smokers within one foot of stepping outside. So you had to walk through a cloud of smoke to get out the door and stand in it while waiting for the valet to retrieve your car.</td></tr>

She offered us free breakfast to make up for this. Now had she just welcomed us and made it sound like they were giving us free breakfast without mentioning the room was tiny in comparison to others, we never would have known! Then the air unit was showing 60 degrees; well it was more like 76. It was humid and the floor felt damp. We called and they sent an "engineer" to fix the unit. He told us to wait 30 minutes. It was just as bad off as when we got there. They offered us free Starbucks, however that does not make up for paying for an expensive room to sweat all night and barely move past the tv and bed to get to the bathroom. After entirely too much back and forth on the phone, they offered to move us. So they did have a regular room available?! It took them a good hour to move us. Will not stay here again! Book elsewhere! Somewhere with updated units! They need customer service training as well.</td></tr>

The hotel has a nice indoor pool, outdoor patio with bar, a small exercise room, a full service restaurant, Starbucks coffee bar, and a club lounge -- all are very nice, but the club lounge is too small for how many rooms it serves. Valet parking is offered, but free self parking is convenient. The hotel is separate from other commercial development, so you'll need a car to drive, but lots of good restaurants and newer shopping are nearby. Weekend rates here are a great value; I would highly recommend staying based on my experience.</td></tr>

The staff also seems abit more like a time share mgmt and less like a hotel and that needs to change. Customer services is job one.

This hotel is also in a good location for city access - restaurants and the arts district, as well as easy freeway access. The pool (we could see from room) looked to be a simple square, but did have nice lounge chairs and cabanas. We upgraded to a Club Level Room and were very happy with the choice!

They asked me at that time for my crediti/debit card for incidentals. Later that day we checked in together. The next day $997.00 was taken out of my checking account via my debit card. Also took the check so were paid twice. It took 3 days for this money to get back into my account. Upon my return, approximatelyl five days later there was $109 taken from my account. Upon calling the hotel, they told me this was for parking. My co-worker had a car and used her card to enter the parking lot, NEVER using mine. That was on 8/30, and today, 9/6, the money is back in my account. This could have caused huge problems if I had not had money in my account to cover. Always check your account/bill.</td></tr>

I chose a Club Level room, and though my room was on the 12th floor instead of the 15th or 16th floors (which is advertised as where the Club Level rooms are located), I still enjoyed the perks of the Club Louge (evening o'dourves, bottled water/beverages, continental breakfast), which were beyond my expectations. The beds were very comfortable and the front desk staff & house keeping were prompt and courteous with my requests.

In addition, I have never been able to enjoy the pool because it is small and always crowded. I love having the restaurant and bar in the hotel.

Some mold on the tile in the bathroom. The lounge is ok. The pool is in need of serious attention. The cushions were just downright nasty. Love the idea of cushions, but should be replaced (or at least cleaned). "Game room" next to pool was a joke. Now the workout facility was outstanding... but no locker facilities.. There is space there, but it is not being used. Why not make a nice his/her locker facility with showers and steam room for his/her.

They were not even going to refund any money to me if they put me in a smaller room... that surely doesnt sound right?!?! Also after 3 requests for a refrigerator we finally got one sometime between 7pm and 1pm (reminding you I checked in at 3), which meant the medicine we needed to put in there had to be kept in the ice bucket. Also upon arrival, we had to unload all of our belongings and pushed our luggage on the cart ourselves. It wasnt until we reached the elevators a staff member notivced and helped us.

Also, during our stay, the silverware and dinnerware at the club lounge were not clean. And the gentleman in charge was very aloof.

The tiny pool closed on labor day even though it was 104 out!!!!! There was no spa. The exercise equipment was great except it faced a painted over window. The food was over priced.

One issue I had was with parking, both my sister and I, as well as another guest we met up with, were under the impression that parking and the shuttle service were free. These important deals were part of the reason we chose this hotel. Much to our dismay, we arrived at the hotel and realized that we had somehow been mistaken, and while the shuttle service to Disneyland was free, parking was not. Not only was parking not free, it was $14 per night! I find this price completely unacceptable. Also, you have to take a ticket when entering that parking lot, but instead of being charged based on this ticket, the parking is charged to your room based on the number of nights you've booked. Because of this, when you leave the parking lot the gate is open and you do not have to turn your ticket in. My issue with this is that any person that is not a guest at the hotel could drive in, take a ticket, park, and then drive out for free since the gate it always open. While they can park for free, I have to pay $14 because I'm STAYING at the hotel? This, to me, is not alright. My other issue was that they took $100 out of my account without any notice at all. I understand that any hotel is going to want to have a credit card on file in case of any incidents, this is pretty standard. Which is why when I arrived at the Belvoir Anaheim and they asked for my card, I was not surprised at all. Since we had paid for our two night stay in advance, I did not expect to see any additional charges on my card. Much to my surprise, when I checked my account later that day, $100 had been taken from my account. When we returned to the hotel that evening, I asked someone at the front desk about the charge and they explained that it was for any incidents and would be returned to my account after our checkout as long as there were no damages or additional charges to the room. I can understand why they do this, my issue is that no one told me about this charge when I checked in, nor was I warned about this charge when I booked the room or in my confirmation... and yes, I did go back and check it. I just think that someone could really be in trouble if they are not planning on an additional $100 coming out of their account, and therefore the staff needs to be sure to inform the guests of this charge. Even better, the guest should be told before booking the hotel that this charge will be taken out at time of checkin. My last issue was that our toilet in our room was difficult to use. We had to flush 2-4 times every time it was used in order to get everything to go down. We decided that we could live with this, so I did not inform staff until we went to the front desk to checkout. When I informed the assistant manager that was checking us out, he only said "ok" and did not thank us or apologize for the broken toilet. He did not seem to be concerned with it at all. Other than the parking, $100 charge, and toilet, I would recommend this hotel. It it beautiful, comfortable, clean, and is the perfect distance from the park.</td></tr>

One of the best nights sleep too on a great bed. The Belvoir is my new favorite place to stay when in NYC and is very reasonably priced - close to the subway too (N/R lines) - but shop around and you'll come back to reserve here and NOT by one of those "discount" websites but direct worked far better - This hotel should be booked solid every night! P.S. I was NOT paid to write this recommendation... I did my homework and I am very fussy and a perfectionist - Thank you for providing a great hotel in a great city</td></tr>

I was very disappointed to learn that the wifi I was paying for was only available in my guest room. The trade show I was attending took place largely in the ballroom, so I needed to gain access to the locked wifi in that area of the hotel. When I approached the concierge, she was icy at best and said I would need to speak with someone at the registration desk. I patiently waited in the registration line for twenty minutes, and when I finally was able to speak with someone, he stated that I couldn't gain access to the wifi (despite my offer to pay an additional fee) because the trade show organizers hadn't purchased it. He suggested I speak with the hotel's event coordinator - however that person wouldn't be back in the office until after the trade show was over. I am deeply disappointed in your hotel's policy and weak customer service. I have suggested that the event move to another, more customer-centric venue in the future.</td></tr>

I come here everyweek but have to beg to get any room in the stanford side for newer carpet. Most hotel would know who you are since coming very week. NOPE, they just DON'T care. I am done here, moving to the crtyd people would be more friendlier and know who you are. If you are here for short trip and need access to run\walk to Stanford, this is the place. But I should\would recommend not coming here if you are regular as they just don't care. The concierge lounge ladies are awesome if there is any cancellation. Bring a flippers the carpet yucks.. The rooms are paper thin and very loud, you can hear all bathroom activity from all directions. I am done here after 16 weeks and move to other option down the street. The wifi is less to be desired, drops and weak download speed. BTW, they keep missing my points for other weeks how complicate is this. Its like they just don't want you to come back..

On the 4th night of our stay, I had a nose bleed. I didn't like that I had to ask the staff to change the sheets (we stayed a total of 8 nights)--they should have changed it because the blood on the sheets was visible. Another thing I didn't like was that pool towels were limited to one per guest; two pool towels per guest would be more ideal. The best part about this hotel was its resort fees because it includes 2 bottles of water and in/out parking privileges per room. Overall, this hotel was a good deal.</td></tr>

Despite of the fact that downtown is dead at night and weekends, the location is only a few blocks away from the art district, Main Street, and West End, you can even take the train to go to those places, which stops pretty much in front of the hotel. All in all it's a pretty good hotel for Belvoir standard, the only complain I have is that the remote control didn't work for the TV menu/movie rental/hotel (check out/hotel info etc).

Great Customer Service & Can't Beat Location!</td><td>We had the pleasure of staying at the Belvoir Seattle as complementary guests of the hotel for two nights. The hotel staff provided exemplary customer service from the moment we arrived, which continued until we checked-out. I give the Belvoir a 4-star rating on excellent customer service, location, and their BPG rates. The Belvoir is located in the heart of downtown, close to Seattle Art Museum, Convention Center, Fishermans Wharf, Pike Place Market, Space Needle and the shopping district. The city hosts some great restaurants and entertainment venues, all within easy walking distance of the hotel. Rooms are clean and comfortable with nice city views, if you prefer the higher floors. The hotel staff were very accommodating and attentive to our needs, providing an overall great hotel experience. A thank you goes out to the hard working staff for extending gracious hospitality and making us feel welcome. I would definitely not hesitate to stay at the Belvoir Seattle Hotel on our next visit. Highly recommend this hotel for both business or private travel.</td></tr>

It is a place to have a lot fun with great pools, club, fun music, shopping and great staff. The room decor is somewhat outdated, but clean. The thing that is crazy is the elevator...the button is in the center of the lobby area on each floor (instead of on the wall) and everyone has to turn their head in circles to see which one will be stopping and then run to it, because the elevators are place around in a semi-circle.

(That's all they take) Seriously, a credit charge for $1.50?? No wonder it was declined. I found an assistance manager who said he had the same problem and that customers had been complaining. Gee, maybe you should fix that?? 3rd: The bathroom was dirty (hair on the countertop and toilet paper in the commode) kleenex box was empty, and two of my towels were stained. And by stained I'm mean: "Gross! I am NOT using those." 4th: At 10:30 (pm) there were four teenage girls in the pool screaming their heads off. I could hear them clearly on the 15th floor. I called the front desk and he assured me he would send someone out to speak to them. I watched the security guard walk to the pool railing, turn around and walk back WITHOUT speaking to anyone. 30 min later the girls quieted down. 5th: I didn't have a receipt under my door as with previous stays, so I went to the front desk to get one. The woman tried her password several times and then said the computer was down and she couldn't print one. (I'm not really buying that) She said she would e-mail one to me before lunch but never did. I had to call the manager the next day to get one. NOT HAPPY! Won't stay again.</td></tr>

The waiter made a point to not stop at our table, and then we watched him see 3 new tables and he even went as far as to take different routes to the back of house. After we realized we were not getting service my wife went to go to the bathroom, and I was going to complain, but the waiter ran to give us the check as he fear we may just walk away... and we did.

Overall we enjoyed our stay but there were constant gaps in processes and communications that made our stay a bit irritating and caused extra work on our part. In addition, i shared this review with customer service, but unsurprisingly, did not get a response back. 1. It took 3 calls to the service desk and 2 days for the extra shampoo to be delivered to our room 2. We opted out for the " green" option one of the days. The next day we needed to get our room cleaned and did not post the "green" door sign. Instead, we got the 5 dollar certificate under the door. Realizing the confusion, we promptly returned the certificate to the front desk and specifically asked for the room to be cleaned. We came back at 10 at night to a dirty room. When called the front desk, the cleaning personnel were unwilling to clean the room at first, then agreed, causing us to sit outside till about 11 PM waiting.  3. I lost my sunglasses at the pool. When calling Lost and Found through the Front desk services, I had to make a new claim each day I called to check on the status. Every time I called, there was no record of my previous inquiry. I had to tell the entire story 3 days. Last day of our stay, it  sounded like someone actually recorded it, but I can not be sure since that was my last daily follow up.  4. Last night of our stay, I ordered a glass of milk to the room. The hotel charged 3 dollar delivery fee and 20% tax summing up to a modest charge of 10 dollars. Not including two call backs asking to specify the milk I wanted.  5. Finally, the bill arrived at the check out charging us for the room again, though the room was paid for in the beginning of the trip. We had to go to the front desk to dispute the charges. Luckily, all was straightened out within minutes, but it would be nice to avoid that experience in the future.  Please take my comments into consideration. That way a hotel this caliber will not appear as inefficient and lacking in service.  Sincerely</td></tr>

I checked in very late due to going directly from the airport to the hospital to be with her. I called the shuttle to pick me up at the hospital and Sylvester and the driver (John?) were extremely kind and sympathic and did all they could to help with my unique situation. Arriving at the check in desk exhausted and weary from travelling since 5am. the young man checking me in, (Mike? I hate that the names are slipping my mind as they were all so exceptional) did everything possible to make it so that my stay would be as comfortable & stressfree as possible by upgrading me to the Club level so I could take advantage of having a breakfast and snacks/drinks whenever I was not at the ICU. He made sure that I knew who the club attendant was and called ahead to let her know I was coming up and would probably need a snack and a drink (for sure!). I was met with open arms even though Sue was cleaning up the lounge for the night. She made sure I got all that I needed, was warm and genuine. I found this to be true of all the ladies in the lounge-especially Lillian, who took me and my niece under her wing and treated us like family-her kindness and warm heart were apparent from the start. She also works in the ICU so she had met my niece the day before and remembered her from there. I can't say enough about wonderful things about everyone who touched us during this difficult time and went above and beyond-you just don't find that often these days and all gave stellar service. The hotel was lovely and a welcoming, calm sanctuary each night after the chaos of being at the hospital. Luckily, my sister has a good prognoisis and was released-and although a very scary time in our lives, I'll always recall the kindness and caring that was shown to me and my family. Kudos for Belvoir for allowing their staff the lattitude to be able to step out of the box and really go the extra mile.</td></tr>

Usually we eat out but when I did ave occasion to eat in the restaurant it was not an enjoyable experience as the staff had to searched for and the food was tasteless.

They eventually offered us another room late on last day (which we declined). The TV remote also was balky, and they also eventually replaced it. The bill was incorrect (too high) the first and second times they offered it to us. Eventually it was correct. They gave us extra Grandbourne points to compensate. On the plus side the shower water was always fine, the beds were great and the restaurant was much improved at dinner. we particularly liked the option of half portions (which turned out to be quite generous for the seared tuna).

In general the facilities are fine and there are lots of local activities which I had limited time to experience. From a business travel standpoint the prices throughout the resort and nearby attractions are significantly above what I would typically spend on a business trip. Food prices are high and drink prices at the bar tend to be as high as the high end hotels in downtown San Francisco. If someone else is paying your travel expenses this is a okay destination. Paying my own expenses as I do I found myself looking constantly to go offsite to the surrounding areas to find more reasonable food prices. The daily resort fee and the parking fee really made the per day cost extremely high for business travel. The conference facilities are fine and they met the needs of the group fairly well. Being a grandfather of 7 I could not imagine bringing my grandkids here unless I hit the lottery. With all the other hotel options in the nearby area I'm sure there are more reasonable rates available. Just because you are at a Disney resort does not mean that you are there to hang with Mickey and should be shouldering the cost of making it the "Happiest place on earth"!

The balconies make this hotel stand out from other hotels however, if you're in the Marina tower you can choose from sunrise or sunset views. We opted for the sunset views over the marina and were not disappointed. The pool area was nice and despite complaints we heard, the pool water temperature was not bad. The Club Lounge is a nice perk if you want to grab a bite to eat and some coffee before you start your day. Parking, at $22 a day, seems overpriced, but then parking at every hotel in San Diego seems overpriced, considering there's a large asphalt lot on nearly every other corner.

When we arrived at 10a.m. we were told we had to wait an hr b/c they needed to check us in before we could get our tickets. 1st problem. Then at the zoo we had issues using our debit card b/c the hotel was holding funds that were greater than the room charge. We paid in cash. I just suggest you confirm the process they are using so you don't have this issue. 2nd problem. Also, we booked this hotel in mid-september b/c it said it has a indoor heated pool but the water was so cold it was difficult to enjoy. 3rd problem that made our stay uncomfortable. Then the next morning getting ready I notice a large finger or toe nail on the floor next to the bed. Gross! Needs better cleaning.</td></tr>

Not too big of deal but it did get stuffy even though the thermostat was set to 65. The hard-wired Internet connection in the room was horrible. There was no documentation in the room explaining the wireless but I figured it out after some time and that seemed a bit more stable oddly enough. The sink in the bathroom had trouble draining the last 2 days of my stay. I did not report it but apparently housekeeping must have. Someone was fixing the room next door at 10:30 p.m. on my last night stay. I happened to be up but if I was sleeping that would have woken me up. Good news is the sink drained like a charm the next morning! I really do like this hotel and would recommend it. Nothing I ran into would prevent me from staying in the future.</td></tr>

I would rather stay at a hotel with a free continental breakfast! I was disappointed in that they didn't give me the code for free internet- you have to ask for it. Other hotels write in on the room key envelope or tell you right away at check in. The bathroom is only large enough for one person. You have to totally be in the bathroom to even close the door for privacy. There is only one mirror (bathroom) in the whole place. Traveling with a group of ladies who like to do hair need more mirrors so that the bathroom doesn't need to be occupied by someone primping. What took the cake, however, was the lack of communication. I gave my email to have them email me my receipt; I got home and did not receive it and had to call them because I wondered why a prepaid room still had to have a $50.00 charge deposit go through my bank account. They do not tell you about this "hidden" charge before hand; also learned that it takes from 1-10 days for it to be reversed! I also had to wait for 25 minutes on hold. The lady broke the 25 minutes up by saying, "this is ....., please hold." I already had been holding a very long time, so I said, "NO!" But lack of sympathy. "Well, I have to get this other call, please hold..." She didn't even wait for me to respond. HOW RUDE. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. My husband and I are from the Kenai Peninsula and TRAVEL A LOT. We value communication and customer service. We will spend our money elsewhere. Also there is about a one inch gap under the front door, so if people are noisy in the hallway you hear it! I didn't mind the train though; it is close but not that close to be bothersome!</td></tr>

Do not stay at this hotel, if they advise you that the resort charge is mandatory, for some guests do not pay it.</td><td>4</td><td>The Resort Charge</td><td>I first stayed at this fine hotel in 1974. Over the years, I have returned frequently. It has been my home, when at Waikiki. The hotel has undergone a number of transformations and refurbishments. This latest incarnation is the best yet. But there is a problem: the so called "mandatory" resort charge. I first learned of this after I had made my reservation for this stay. Being advised by an email from the hotel that the charge was mandatory, I accepted this as fact, and when asked at check in if I knew about the charge, I dutifully replied in the affirmative and paid it. But shortly, the disappointment began, followed by outrage. When I went to log in to the "free" (a benefit of paying the resort charge) WiFi, the screen informed me that the charge would be $14 per day, but IF I were paying the resort charge, it would be free. "IF"? This implied that some hotel guests were not paying the resort charge. Then I noticed costs associated with certain activities in the weekly planner booklet given us. But, other documentation advised us that "IF" we had paid the resort charge, those activities would be free. So, the next day, in a friendly manner, I started asking some hotel guests I randomly met if they had paid the resort charge. It was in this manner that I learned that some had not. Well, it was obvious at that point, anyway. While the list of "benefits" associated with the resort charge is lengthy and interesting, given a proper choice at check in, I would have declined to pay it. The amount was about $125 for our 5 night stay. A better investment would have been 10 Mai Tai's -- 1 for me and 1 for my wife, daily. I did raise this issue at check out, as I was asked if I had any problems during my stay, but of course the response was just a sympathetic smile. Nothing could be done. I have been loyal to the Belvoir Waikiki for nearly 40 years, but I find the imposition of the so-called mandatory resort charge to be deceptive and outrageous. This is no way to treat your loyal customers. It is no way to treat anyone. The next time I travel to Waikiki, I will check to see if your hotel still imposes the resort charge. If it does, I will stay elsewhere. I shall not return until the resort charge is eliminated, and I am advising others headed for Waikiki to do the same. It's a shame really. You have such a fine facility, and such a friendly and competent staff. Yet you have chosen, through management greed, to undermine and negate these strengths through deceptive marketing of a resort charge. If you really need extra income from guests, just build the charge into your rates. I hope to stay with you again some day, but this may have been my last stay. It's up to you. Aloha!</td></tr>

Also, if you are looking for a hotel with a relaxing pool area, then this is your place. The infinity pool and lounging area was wonderful and the staff very attentive.</td></tr>

This was our first 20 min in the New York Belvoir; The bell hops were so frantic to beat each other to the luggage it was gone before we were able to pay the taxi. We opened our own taxi doors. We found our luggage on a rack and proceeded to check in. There was no "Welcome to New York" at check in but .."your room is not ready". A bell hop stood 2 inches behind me with his hand out. I handed him a tip wondering what exactly he had done for us as I was told we had to take our luggage to the storage, pay $3.00 per bag (never heard of a hotel doing this before) We tried to navigate the rack but were told we had to take it off so we lifted our bags off ourselves and wheeled them over to the storage. Ridiculous. Most guests learned to go through the side door and hail their own cab as they also expect a tip for hailing a cab when the cabs are already there.This is NOT customer service. It is harrasment. Also the safe would not unlock and it took over an hour to get something delivered to our room. As a result we slept in your hotel but did not try the restaurant or bar . I love the Grandbourne brand, I am a lifetime Grandbourne Gold member. I was expecting the excellent service and welcome that I am accustomed to and this was so dissapointing, particularly when this was a special celebration weekend.</td></tr>

Facility and room was clean and no complaint there. We requested a baby crib and the hotel brought us a park n' play with cardboard bottom - no mattress - which is so thin I was afraid to put my baby in it. Also, hotel's ventilation system is probably old and we noticed in the morning that all our clothing felt soggy from moisture. In addition, around 8 pm on first night, I had to wait at the front desk for more than 15 minutes because there was only one person to handle 3~4 guest lined up. I love this hotel and would probably come back in the future, but I would certainly like to see some improvements in its service.</td></tr>

They room was very pretty quite but I could hear people slamming their doors and running around in the halls. I think there was conference for "slumber party host's" at that hotel so it was kind of irritating surfing through all the giggling people in glitter. lol. Not the hotels fault for irresponsible guests. BUT for the most part my stay was good. I DID opt for the "go green" way and didn't have my towels and sheets changed. The only problem with this I found was that they didn't do ANYTHING. not make the bed, empty the trash, restock the shampoo. Nada. I was under the impression that it would just involve no towel service and linen change. Oh well. I still had a good stay. How much shampoo does a person REALLY need anyway, right? :)</td></tr>

The rooms were spacious but the carpet is in need of cleaning and the pillows were all big and uncomfortable.

(And that it was $14.95 per 24 hours.) Most hotel affinity programs now offer this option. The green program is one I support however, when it was explained to me I was told that I could request towels and a linen change part way through my stay since I was there 7 nights. (Note: They said 7 nights at chek-in but when I checked out on the last day of the conference I was told my reservation for was 8 nghts and I was charged a $20 early check out fee!!!! The day I asked for new towels I called at 7:00 am and when I returned to my room at 5:30 pm to take a shower - no towels. I had to call a second time to get them. One morning I clumsily spilled a cup of coffee on the bed linens. I called and asked to have them changed, was told yes and they asked what time. I repsonded I would be out until 1:30. Fine. I returned at 1:30 to a phone message saying that they could not change my sheets because I had opted for the green program. I explained the situation and agreed to turn in oine of my vouchers, again, was told it would happen. I returned at 9:30 that night exhausted and no clean sheets. I called again and was told it was not possible to change the sheets that late at night but they would do it in the morning. I was checking out the next morning so there was no satisfactroy conlcusion of the issue. I felt the green program was really about just plain being cheap.</td></tr>

Well I got there around 1:30 pm and no rooms were available ( had reserved 2 rooms and preferred them to be close to each other). I was told I would get a call when the rooms were ready. NEVER RECEIVED A CALL!!! So when the time reached close to 4pm I decided to go to the front desk to check and still no rooms available. Checked again close to 5 and was finally told there maybe rooms but still had to wait. AGAIN NEVER RECEIVED A CALL!! I had to continuously go to the front desk hours after the 3pm check in time. Also was told about additional holds on my credit card (for incidentals and was charged per room) that was not told to me when I made the reservations. Finally got the rooms then in one of them the sheets/beddings were dirty! Had reserved the club lounge floor but was given rooms somewhere else. Club lounge stated snacks, drinks, etc. all day and that was not the case. And I told the customer service rep I only had one car eventhough I reserved 2 rooms. Told them that several times and still when I got my receipt and when I went to check out I was questioned about how many cars I had and the extra parking fees had to be removed. I was very much disappointed with the services.</td></tr>

Everything else in the room seemed very clean and well kept. I would like to give special kudos to the food service staff. They were very concerned with getting your food right and on time and called after delivery to make certain everything was good. That was a nice touch. The owner should talk to the City of Houston transportation department, as we waitied in traffic on the frontage road, which is the only entry, for 30 minutes to get to the driveway.

This is misleading and should certainly be addressed immediately and stated on their website. When checking in, the staff was helpful and stated that we could go up to the lounge and get water. After a long day out, I went up to the lounge and tried to get water. Since I could not access the refridgerator, I called the front desk. Whomever answered the phone was VERY rude and should NOT be in customer service as they told me I should not be there and cut me off everytime I tried responding to her questions. Rediculous!

I love the location because it is away from all the Duvall happenings so when it is time for bed there is no extra noise to contend to yet it is close to the beach and many other activities.</td></tr>

Unfortunately, I was placed on the other side in the tower. This area seems to be older and somewhat dingy. My first issue was a broken TV remote control. Not a big deal and they quickly replaced it. Next I set up my laptop and prepared to log in only to find out that they are still charging for internet. $8 per night for low speed (which was horrible) and $24 per night for high speed. Next you find out that they don't have wireless. Really??? Before I could use the wired option I had to have the ethernet cable replaced due to a broken end piece. Now I'm finally hooked up ready to get some work done while watching Monday night football. My next issue was the TV. It's a beautiful big flat screen and they seem to be up to date because 80% of the channels are HD. Unfortunately none of the HD channels work. I had to scrap the horrible internet that I already paid for and watch the game in the lobby. I also had issues with my toilet. It would run continuously and was very loud so I was constantly jiggling the handle trying to get it to stop in the middle of the night. After my long night I headed to the lobby to find some coffee because no one likes the horrible little coffee makers in the rooms. The coffee never tastes good when it comes out of one of those things. I was happy to see that they had coffee available but unhappy to see that it was $2 per cup. After paying a premium room rate, paying to park (yes you must pay to park here), and paying for internet... Paying $2 for coffee was a little more than irritating. I will not be using this hotel again.</td></tr>

Thats why we were stuck in a room right by elevator and it sounded like a party in the hall all night when people came in. Didn't sleep well at all. We were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary so I was disappointed. All the other reviews were great so that made me even more disppointed.</td></tr>

He made us feel like a VIP. Rooms were great. The doors to the rooms need to be adjusted so they do not slam when people exit into the hallway.

However, the only option the front desk could offer us was a McDonalds about 10 minutes away (Not an option for my family). We set out to find a place for something light and found Smokey Bones (open until 2AM). My suggestion is that the front desk staff have a list of restaurants in the area and their hours of operation for those unfortunate times when guest have been delayed and famished upon arrival. Having salads at the gift shop would have solved the problem. Ask not to be put in the corner of the hotel, after a very long day & night, we awoke the next morning to the roaring of HVAC units on the roof just above the corner room we had been assigned.

Not every room has a balcony so be sure to request it if you want it and make sure they save it for you. They also allow pets, which we did not know. The room next to us left a small dog and the poor creature barked the entire day and night. We contacted the front desk, but I guess there is only so much they can do. Not to mention that my husband is severely allergic to cats. Had we know animals were allowed we would not have stayed at this hotel.</td></tr>

I ordered room service which took three seperate tries and being connected multiple times and when the food arrived it was horrible. The next morning I ventured for a cup of coffee which was an adventure as the resturant still had the closed sign and I had to ask three different people for assistance s they did not know why it was not open yet only to find later they forgot to change the sign.

Such a great decision! My Nana and I had many many remarks about how spacious it is at this hotel, it is like the space took a giant inhalation and has suspended itself in time. If you love the water, this place is for you! I took the trolley many of our snorkeling, snuba, and swimming adventures. There is also a pier in walking distance away where you can hop on a boat to go out to great snorkeling spots, rent a kayak, or a paddleboard. The free breakfast was one of my favorite reasons for being here. And the beds were wonderful, I overheard other guests saying this too. The staff was so kind!! And the pools are beautiful. Once I saw dolphins in the ocean as I was walking around the spacious, beautiful gardens right next to the pool. This is a great spot! The trolley was really nice too. We were there for a week without renting a car, but after 1 week it seems like a car is needed. I had a great time at this place =. There are many events in the mornings, like hula lessons and yoga. Once I walked around the lava rocks in the morning, at the edge of the ocean just outside of the hotel, and there is so much life there!! It was beautiful. Beautiful beautiful beautiful. Oh! If you can, visit the fern rainforest and lava tube, it is on the other side of the island, but definitely worth the trip.</td></tr>

BUT--if you have a rental (or borrowed) car, forget the Belvoir Princess!! The parking garage is a hopeless maze, and if you have any problems with stairs then don't even bother.

The room was clean and comfortable, however, the staff is well below Grandbourne standards. I checked in early and they were to call me on my cell when my room was ready. Several hours later I checked at the desk and the room was ready but no one ever called. The staff did not go over any Gold options, did not explain the Wi-Fi (some Belvoir's you have an access code other you just log on and hope the bill is credited), did not offer a 4:00 PM checkout and when I went to use the Club Room my key was not programmed for access requiring an additional trip to the desk. When I went to check my bags while I was waiting for my room the two people at the bell desk sat there and talked about work for five minutes while I waited. I know it was five minutes as by then I was curious to see how inattentive this staff could be so I was looking at my watch. Now I just checked my personal credit card (the one on my profile) and they charged my stay on that card and not the card I presented at check-in although the room was not a prepay. I now must attempt to credit one card and charge the other (Grandbourne billing is another nightmare as I'm still waiting for a call regarding a stay in August). The upside is I lived in San Diego for eight years and the renovation of the property was excellent as I know what it used to look like. Honestly, I would stay there again as the views and room were wonderful but don't expect Grandbourne standards with the staff.</td></tr>

She placed a call to the Sunday AM Front Desk Agent, but they did not know what was "Gym-In-The-Bag". The front desk supervisor did not know about this particular service or option, but extended her an invite to use the gym facilities. The Club Level Breakfast was hosted by Ms. Monique, a hospitality professional with personality and a friendly touch. Food was hot, well stocked, beverages were refreshing and plentiful. We sat in the overflow in the front of the room and enjoyed the spacious and cushioned seating on the chairs and couch. Check-out was Great! Called for valet and the same gentleman who name I can not recall, Was Back On-Duty. My two young boys were as excited as I was to see him return to check us out. He called prior to his arrival to check to see if we were ready to receive him. That was Just the WOW Factor you can appreciate from a service provider.

Once I was finally checked in and I went upstairs to my room, I was shocked to find the room not cleaned. There were empty soda, beer and liquor boxes and other trash left in a closet. Also left in the closet was a foil pan with fried chicken and baked beans, obviously left over from a party. The next morning, upon pulling back the shower curtain, there was hair in the floor of the shower stall.

Breakfast was awesome, staff was really good and overall room was quiet. One negative on the club level we could here some type of compressor running throughout the evening from the roof.

I could see from the Empire State Building all the way around to CT! Great at night. The hotel resteraunt was one of the best I've been to and the price was very reasonable. The food was served very hot, well presented, and was delicious. Drinks were a bit expensive. Only issue is location. It is smack dab in the middle of the "Chinatown" of Queens. Most all of the resturaunts in the area did not have menus in English and did not take credit cards. Since the hotel restaraunt was so good, it wasn't an issue for us. The rooms were very quiet from outside noise, but could hear people in hall and other rooms a little bit. Will always stay here when I'm in the area. Thanks!!</td></tr>

Instead we learned the room we were assigned had twin beds even when I had checked an option stating that it was our honeymoon. The only perk was that we were able to get a king size bed!

The good-The location is great, the staff are friendly and we were pleased to see that the rooms have been updated. The bad-the elevators are terrible! They are not traditional in that you don't just push a button at the elevator bank and wait for the first one. These elevators require you to enter your floor number, then it flashes a car number for you to wait for. Sounds easy, and as though it would be more efficient but, it doesn't work out well in reality. I can't tell you how many people I've seen that are confused by this, end up getting frustrated and holding things up. The line to get to the elevator during Mardi Gras is just awful! Don't expect to get up to your room or down to the lobby quickly if it's a busy time. Now, the ugly-our most recent visit was 9/22/12. The hotel is in the process of renovating the lobby so it now feels kind of like an airline terminal that is also under construction (hopefully that will improve!) We had requested an early check in but were delayed in arriving due to convention traffic and didn't arrive till 3 pm. There was a line to check in that wasn't too long but, we were told that our room had not been cleaned yet and so we couldn't check in. I gave them my cell phone number to call when the room was ready and was assured that it would be less than an hour. An hour and a half later we still hadn't gotten a call and had to get back into a much longer check in line where we remained for another 20-30 min. When we finally got to the desk we were told a room was still not available and they didn't know how much longer it would be. There were not enough attendants to check all the guests in and we were not the only ones unable to check in-there were 30-40 people sitting in chairs in the lobby area with their luggage, some curled up on pillows some laying down on the floor- it looked like we were at an airport that had been snowed in, cancelled all flights and passengers were bedding down! We had dinner reservations, we're meeting friends and were looking forward to some time alone without the kids (got the 'romance package' that was supposed to come with chocolates and champagne in the room-never did get those). Spending the few hours we had together in a line sucked. We were persistent (refused to move till we got a room) and got a room within 20 minutes but missed our dinner reservation and were late to meet our friends. The hotel did try to compensate us but, I would've rather had it go right. We chose the Belvoir because they usually are on the ball with check in compared to many other N.O. Hotels. Something has changed and that is no longer true. Cheaping out on staff? Poor management? Who knows, I just know I won't be staying there come next Mardi Gras!</td></tr>

We had one minor bathroom issue, which was fixed immediately, once we notified the staff actually spoke to a very nice gentleman, an electrical or maintenance supervisor, I believe, on the elevator.

To make matters more aggravating, this is one of those hotels that charges $15/night for mid-grade internet connectivity, and that is per device!</td></tr>

We were also told that we were upgraded to a beach room and that our window looked out at the water. Well, 3:00 came and our room was still not ready. 3:15, and we started to complain and another lady came up to the desk and completed the process and gave us our room. We get up to the room and the view from the window was that of the hotel next door, not of the beach. We called and spoke to the manager and she had an attitude and acted as if she could care less. Apparently, none of those rooms have a view of the ocean. Either way, the manage was not helpful or polite at all. I will never stay at a Sharaton again.</td></tr>
