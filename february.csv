This hotel was nice and clean. I was quite impressed after staying there for a day the next afternoon the clerk welcomed me by name! she smiled and was professional and friendly. The 1900 Bar restaurant downstairs had good food. I was beyond impressed with our server Sally. She was gracious and kind and went beyond her job. (Give that lady a raise!). This type of customer service is a breath of fresh air and not seen very often these days. Thank you for a great stay!

We waited over 15 minutes to get water when we were the only diners present, then another 15 to order, and another 35 minutes to get our food, during which time we had no staff attention of any sort.

However, my room was nowhere near the elevator shaft, room 3123, and I could hear the elevators constantly. In room menu was very limited and more expensive than I usually see, but the food was good. I would have gone out for food, but needed to work. The carpet in the hallway on my floor was worn through and bunching up- possible trip hazard. We had a 6 hour meeting in a room that apparently backed up to a main street and we could hear cars and trucks throughout the presentations. The biggest issue was that after the first night, my phone in my room did not work and therefore my internet connection would not work. I called and an engineer came to check on it, but all he did was plug/unplug the phones which I had already done. He said someone else would have to repair it the next day so I told him I would be out of the room by 8:30 AM. No one ever came to repair the phones so for a little over 2 days I did not have phone or internet in the room and I had to work from the lobby- others in my group also had phone problems from their rooms. I would not recommend the hotel and unfortunately we have a large customer meeting in the same hotel in June."

Used Starpoints (10,000) for the booking. We checked in at 2:30 P.M. Friday to a very nice room with an ocean view and decided to take a nap before going out to the show. Didn't happen, as construction hammering was going on literally right over our heads and didn't stop, even after a call to the front desk. OK, I understand they need to make improvements, so we went out instead. The Cirque show was wonderful, but believe it or not we were woke up at 8:00 A.M the next morning (Saturday!!) by the same construction banging. SATURDAY MORNING AT 8:00 A.M.--this is completely unacceptable for any hotel, anywhere. We were willing to let the afternoon noise slide, but 8:00 A.M. on the weekend is just ridiculous. We called (twice) and the desk said they would take care of it because the workers weren't supposed to start until 9:00 on Saturday (they let them work Saturday morning when people are sleeping in...???). Noise didn't stop, so we went out to breakfast, then checked out. Spoke to the manager on checking out and she was very apologetic and said she would credit our account back the Starpoints. However, this hasn't happened, so not only were we woke up at 8:00 A.M. on Saturday morning, we were apparently lied to about being compensated for the mess. Too bad, because the people there were overall very nice and friendly; they've just got a terrible problem on their hands with the construction noise.

(probably 60% of the restaurant). there were no clean plates or silverware due to this. the food, once we were able to get a plate and eating utensils was pretty good however. i had a problem with the wifi code and the young man at the desk took care of it for me. we needed a cab on both days to get to the convention center and on sunday when i asked for a cab to be hailed for me the courtesy van driver volunteered to drive us. he was very nice and even pointed out some notable facts about the town as we drove. he even detoured us so we could drive past the kennedy assasination spot. except for one day in the restaurant, i cant say enough good things about the staff at this hotel."
