If you need peace and quiet, this isn't for you</td><td>4</td><td>Majoring in Mediocrity</td><td>There was nothing terrible about our stay but lots of little annoyances that add up to wishing we had been somewhere else. Our king bed reservation turned into 2 doubles and the person who checked us in insisted they were 2 queens--which is why we took the room. She should have been better informed. She also knew nothing about the gold welcome amenity and had to ask someone else. Our room had a broken safe and we had to call for service on it twice which made us late for where we were going. I had lots of trouble with the computer in the lobby, and the set-up is such that everyone in that lobby can see what you're working on. That's flat out wrong. I even get the idea of creating more energy and connectedness in the lobby by putting the work stations there, but give people a little personal privacy when they're on the computer. And the elevators took too long. Too many people coming and going--like a factory. And finally, I can't believe they are still charging $10 a day for the fitness center. Come on people. If you have to charge, make this one of the gold amenities. I didn't need that free drink. I need a workout in the morning. I am a committed BPG member but I would only stay here with points, I would never pay to stay here.</td></tr>

The staff was pleasant and graceous, however, It took us 2 hours, yes TWO, to check in. During this time they did offer refreshments, but what I really wanted was to get settled. Murmurs through the crowd were they're just not prepared to handle large crowds. Are you kidding me? They sit next door to the convention center. Crowds should be their speciality. Once our room assignments were given we arrived on the 8th floor to piles of laundry on the floor outside of rooms. I was skeptical as I entered my room, which was okay. Didn't eat there as prices were exorbitant and again long lines. Check out made easy on the TV wasn't working , so back to standing in another line. Overall VERY disappointing. I've stayed at lesser hotels with more attention to the customer.</td></tr>

And the manager (Kenny) who helped my wife and me when we had to stay in New York for two more days than we had planed was super! The location of the hotel is perfect, right in the heart of Manhattan. We stayed in the club floor which was fabulous! The club lounge was incredible. The room was clean and we had a great view down 7th Avenue. The beds are very comfy.</td></tr>

There were two used 'contact lens' on the floor when I arrived - and I don't wear contact lens - so they were not mine. So this means that the maid didn't vacuum the floor from the previous occupant.

We are from Atl, and was required to stay in town for 3 days. When I booked the reservation, I was told $129 for first night & $151 for 2nd night and it was a breakfast & bed package. I did not get the B & B for Tues because I had surgery that morning and could not eat anything. On Tues during my surgery, my husband returned to the hotel to update our room key, because the gal told us in would expire at noon. While she was updating his key, she handed him a breakfast card with May 1st on it, so he then had pancakes before returning to the hosp. The next morning, we went down for our breakfast, and the waitress said that he had used up our free breakfast the day before, therefore we needed to pay for our 2 breakfasts. I didn't think much of it, thought it was just a little mess-up. I then reviewed our portfolio from both nights and was shocked to see several charges that were incorrect. At 11:30 when I approached the hotel desk, the woman was very rude and could not explain all our extra charges. She called the food manager, which seem odd to me because she didn't handle to charges. The two of them scambled for about 25 mins, looking at food receipts trying to prove that I was wrong. I have never had this type of unprofessional treatment at any up scaled hotel! When I left the hotel, they still didn't have it straightened out and assured me they would call or email me ASAP, as of today all I've recieved is the same bill from that morning. Another incident happended to my husband in our room, specially walking into the bathroom that have 2 small french doors W/ long metal door handles. He was trying to pour water out of the ice bucket, and ran his arm into the handle, and it is badly bruised. He was it pain, and he had to put ice on it to get the swelling down. Maybe you should look at that design, and make it more accessible.</td></tr>

I have been staying at this location the night prior to my departure flight for the last 15+ years and had watched the property as it showed signs of aging. About two years ago I had to go through some discomforts during a lengthy renovation process. The staff has always been first class even during the frustration of renovations. The end product now makes it all worth while, from the brightness to newly furnished rooms, fitness facilities and re-opened lounge. The staff now seems even more cheerful if that is possible. Still a couple small faux pauxs like no extension phone in bedroom and lack of easily accessible electric outlets near work desk. I'm sure they will correct shortly.</td></tr>

They do need enough beach chairs for all the guests, but the help at the beach were great. Our room with a balcony was nice, small but we knew that . The only downfall is the small coffee spot. Really needs to offer more in food and service. We would definitely stay here again</td></tr>

To start with I was told over the phone when I booked that I would have a room with a microwave and a fridge, that I would have free internet access, and that a late check out due to the marathon would be no problem. While arriving at the hotel, I was unaware of the parking situation in Columbus so I was a bit confused about what I needed to do. I had one staff member outside tell me while I was waiting behind several vehicles that valet parking was free for those staying for the marathon. At this point I had already been through 2 hours of hunting for parking places through surrounding garages and it was getting late. When the staff member got to me to take my car he told me it was a $30 charge, completely different than what I was just directed. Because I had already been waiting for so long and needed to make the marathon dinner, I was just going to pay it. He then told me i couldn't pay with a credit card and I would have to go get cash. At this point I was already ready to call the hotel and cancel my stay, but I didn't. I found a parking spot at the columbus commons parking area that a random person outside told me about. While checking in I was there was only one room option available regardless of what I was guaranteed over the phone, so I had no fridge or microwave for food options. By the time I got checked into the hotel it was later than the marathon dinner event they were holding. The phone in my room didn't work so every time I needed something I had to use my cell phone. I called a staff member who said he would bring me a menu and that he could have the kitchen make a pasta dish for me if I go down to the lounge. I went into the lounge and they told me they don't do special dishes and I have to order what is offered at those times on their menu. It was almost 1030 pm and I hadn't eaten dinner yet. I couldn't leave the hotel out of fear that I would run into loss of parking spots again because of the number of people in town for this event. From here I spoke to a lady at the front desk who gave me a catering menu of delivery options. I went back upstairs to my room and called and they were closed. It took everything to not call the manager and ask for my money back. I wasn't in marathon event mode anymore and was about to skip everything and drive back home. I spoke to another gentleman who gave me pizza places who will deliver. I tried to log onto my laptop to look at pizza menu when it asked me to pay for this service. So when i called the front desk she told me this service is only available to certain rooms. Once again I had been given false information from several different staff members. I called pizza hut and ordered something simple. The guy who delivered the order called me when he arrived to the hotel and told me that the people at the front desk were not letting him come up to the room. They even commented to me when I let them know how my night has been so far- that it isn't their fault I didnt make it in time for the runners dinner. But my wait for valet parking and the run around from employees outside had a huge part to deal with how late I was able to check in. I was beyond angry at this point. I'm a very patient person but I didn't know how much more I could handle from this hotel. I went to bed after eating with the hopes that the next day would be a new day. After the marathon event I came to my room and called the front desk just to confirm that I was okayed the late checkout. I didnt want to deal with interuptions while getting cleaned up after the race. The gentleman I spoke with was very rude to me and asked who I talked to because they never allow late check outs and I should be charged for this. I told him the lady who said this was ok and he said ok fine but we never do this just for future reference and hung up on me. While I was in the shower I had someone knock on my door several times. I'm assuming it was housekeeping and they weren't informed of my late checkout. So it wasn't just a fluke that the first night was horrible for me- the whole experience at this hotel was bad from beginning to end. The cost of this hotel is not cheap compared to others. To not have a complimentary breakfast, free internet service, and deal with all of the complications of food ordering, nonworking phone in the room, no fridge or microwave- this stay wasn't even close to worth what I paid. I'm leaving this lengthy review so everyone can see the details of what happened. All of the staff members at this hotel need to be on the same page because I was given a different story the whole time. Employees should know what food options are available for guests who aren't from around there and whether parking is free, and they should see what you were guaranteed on the phone while booking the hotel room. I will never ever stay here again. I will still be calling about this experience as well. I stay in hotels on a frequent basis and this was the worst experience I have ever had!!</td></tr>

Beware of the pool/hot tub; heavily chlorinated. It bleached out 4 of our swimsuits, after the 2nd day of going and we realized it and I wouldn't let my daughter go back. It turned a black swimsuit brown. Not sure if it was just during our stay but I would double check before entering.</td></tr>

The lounge and links business center are also nice. This hotel is a very short walk to the metro, providing easy access to downtown D.C. and it is also one stop away from Reagan Airport.

My company was sponsoring the event. The banquet staff & food was excellent. The meeting coordinators were great. I was very disappointed in the lobby restaurant however. On my departure morning I dined at breakfast time by myself. I was placed in the absolute very back corner of a large open space. It was actually funny seeing all the single people sitting around the outside edge of the dining room. My waiter was inattentive. I asked for something and never received it. He finally showed up after I had finished my meal. The lady sitting next to me requested some brown sugar for her oatmeal. Not a difficult request. The waiter (same one) just looked over toward the buffet and told her he did not see any. I was mad for her and told the waiter to go ask the chef for the brown sugar. It was amazing how unhelpful he was. They call this a service industry??</td></tr>

The room seemed fine at first check but lacked basic toiletries that are always standard at Grandbourne Hotels (shower gel, toothpaste, q-tips). Our first negative experience was room service- we called at midnight after arriving to order off the very limited late nightdining menu. The menu has salad, sandwiches or cereal. We called to ask for cereal and were told that is not on the menu. when we informed room service that it is, they said "ok" but it will take 45 minutes! for cereal! we decided not to order it.</td></tr>

I was told I could get a king or queen if it became available but of course that just means if they were unsuccessful at booking the higher rate, aka 'no'.

The room I received had trash all over and was clearly not cleaned, and was a room with 2 double beds instead of 1 king as I had requested. The manager moved me to a room with a king bed after I complained and after I was hung up on initially by the hotel staff member answering the phone. The concierge was also very rude, stating at one point, "I have the same information you do, so what do you expect me to help with?" The shower did not drain and would fill with water during a 15 minute shower, but I gave up after letting housekeeping know about it twice.

I was checked in immediately without hassle or argument. The view was nice, the room was quiet, and I was able to work in peace. The hotel is close to many restaurants and the area is safe - I walked alone at 2 in the morning though I didn't go far. My only complaint is that the hotel is HUGE. You do not have to leave the hotel to get what you need but you might get a bit turned around. The staff was amazingly responsive and the food at the hotel restaurant was excellent and didn't upset my delicate stomach (a major plus because that means the ingredients are of good quality). When I realized that I had only an 1 hour and 1/2 to get my flight, the bell staff was on the move and I was in a cab in moments. I didn't make the flight, but that was the airport (which I could complain about endlessly), not the Belvoir. I would stay there again even braving the airport for the opportunity.</td></tr>

Good service is being consistent and meeting customer cutomer expectations. I stayed their 8 nights. Also, I rented a refrigerator and the first one wasn't working and by morning all my food was warm. That was irritating.

The staff was very nice and pleasantly answered any questions. You should expect to pay approx. $20 - $30/day additional to your room rate for parking. Information in the room about the hotel amenities was slightly out of date, and there were no maps of downtown in the room. The TV interface provides some internet, but there was no keyboard to use this option. The room is set up for your own computer, which is a plus. Finally, something as simple as contacting guest services was unnecessarily complicated - the room literature indicated to dial 0, one phone indicated dial 61 and a second phone had a short cut button to call. Only the second phone short cut button worked, dialing 0 or dialing 61 resulted in ringing - but no answer. Of course, once contact was made, the service was great.

It was an overnight trip so no need to change rooms, but Ive noticed for the last few trips that the bathrooms have mold, and it really grosses me out so that is something the hotel can work on.

However once you exit the elevator to the floor where your room will be located, it becomes obvious that this hotel needs to be updated. The hallways have a distinct smell to them, which I can only decribe as "old". The decorations followed in the same theme as the smell. Once inside the room things improved but not by much. The beds were comfortable and the temperature was easily controlled. That covers the positives. The bathroom was small with a no frills shower/tub and a toilet that appeared to have been removed from an airplane. The drains in both the tub and sink barely worked. At one point I thought I must have accidentaly closed the drain . The windows would have had a decent view if they were not cloudy from lack of washing. The TV was old and below what you would expect from a nice hotel. The customer service at the front desk was nice but subsequent responses including one to fix the "airplane" toilet were delayed. The valet is basically mandatory at a fairly steep price. Overall my wife was not happy with our stay which thankfully was only for one night. I will book elsewhere in future trips.</td></tr>

I'm assuming these were being switched out? The wallpaper was peeling away from the wall and the lamp had a high pitch squeal when plugged in. The TV stations were kind of spotty. The light over the bathroom sink only had two of the three bulbs working.</td></tr>

As the Departments I came into contact with most frequently, Valet, Concierge, and Bell Services provided unparalled hospitality. After such a long stay it was nice to have so many greet me by name and friendly smiles. In addition, every other staff member I came in contact with: Restaurant, Maintenance, Front Desk, Banquets, Housekeeping, A/V, were amazingly pleasant. I could easily provide a list of names of exceptional staff members. Although I was anxious to get home, I was saddened to leave my new Belvoir Atlanta family.

I wish this was mentioned somewhere on their website. The staff was very friendly and very efficient upon check in, it took it no longer than a couple of minutes to get our room keys and our bags in the door. The bathroom could use some updating, it is more standard than what I thought a Belvoir hotel would offer. Speaking of things they should offer at no additional costs, the Wi-Fi was an additional fee, but that wasn't too much of a problem because they do have a complimentary computer station on the main floor for guests. They also do not offer complimentary breakfast with the room. I hope I can stay here again once renovations are finished.</td></tr>

We were told by Maria the mananger that she would change the room to the same kind of room on the same floor. We had to get our things together, move to the new room to find that the sink was stopped up in the bathroom! We are very disappointed at our stay and were treated like Oh Well! I will never stay here again and to be memebers we expected to be treated with more respect than that!</td></tr>

This stay however was not the same experience. The hotel experience all but ruined our vacation to disney. I would recommend staying at another hotel based on the poor service at the Dolphin. Hotel is overpriced for the service you receive and attention you receive. To start things off we waited over 30 minutes in line to check-in. Upon checking in our rooms were not ready. They told us they would call when the rooms were ready. They did call us and we left Epcot and returned to the hotel to find our rooms were still unavailable and the call was made in error. This is after waiting another 30 minutes in line to speak with someone at the desk. The front desk is far too understaffed. The hotel charges some $14 a day for resort fee including two bottles of water. We did not receive any water during the stay. Instead we called the desk and they said we could come down and get it...really? Just another way they attempt to scam you. The door to our room was broken and nothing was done to fix it. I can go on and on but I will spare the rest.</td></tr>

I had booked a suite because I wanted extra space due to a knee injury which requires crutches and a wheelchair. When we got to the room, the layout was very cramped and awkward. When I called the front desk to ask if there was another suite, 2 Nicoles and the Asst. Mgr worked with my situation and offered to upgrade us to the Governor Suite at no extra charge which had a much more open floor plan and worked out perfectly! Thanks so much!! Also, special thanks to Beverly in the Club Lounge for being so friendly and helpful and arranging for us, my daughter and her boyfriend to be able to order room service right in the lounge! Thanks to Linda from room service who was kind enough to come up and take our orders and bring them to us in the lounge on the evening of the 10th. At approximately 5:45am on May 12 the fan or vent right over our bed started making a horrible, loud grinding noise and woke me up. Special thanks to Tom at the front desk for being sympathetic but informing us that maintenance did not arrive until after 7am and assuring us that someone would come take a look at it as soon as they came in. The noise continued for over an hour, making it impossible to get back to sleep. When it suddenly stopped at around 7:00, I spoke to Tom again and informed him and he said he would make a note and have someone check on it after we checked out and offered us free breakfast coupons. The noise came back for about 5 minutes once later. Check out was a computerized mess. We were charged for the first night separately because the second night was on points but apparently they had charged the card we gave them at check in (even though we had said we would be changing card at check out) without giving us the itemized bill under the door for us to check on! When we had returned to the hotel on the evening of the 11th, our keycards did not work and had to be reprogrammed, and a new $50 deposit had to be left for the second night, which was inconvenient and confusing When my husband tried to use the card to get up to the club lounge for breakfast in the morning, it didnt work for that either. When he went to the desk, the woman told him that since the room was under my name, I would have to come down with ID to authorize the card or something but since he didnt want me to have to come downstairs on my crutches or in the wheelchair, he told her nevermind. At check out, Kyle was very nice and apologetic about all the mix ups. Despite all the glitches, because of the exceptional staff, I would definitely stay there again, in fact, I look forward to when I can get around better to I can explore Springfield properly. Thank you!</td></tr>

The wallpaper in the bathrooms is beginning to peel and is very noticeable. The curtains in our room were somewhat threadbare and light shone through in several small spots, looking like stars. You will want to get an oceanfront suite, floor 6 or higher with a balcony. You can see the oceans, about 2 blocks away, and the view of the Grand Strand of hotels is great at night.

The gap between the sweetened reviews and the sad reality on site is unbelievably huge. Some reviewers can impossibly have stayed at that same place. How come nobody complains about the invading plane and airport noise, the obvious signs of wear and tear in the rooms, how come nobody points out the high chlorine levels in the pool, the number of Band-Aids and other stuff in the water, the dirty pool towels... The reality on the hotel beach has nothing to do with the beach reviews as well. While we were actually physically there on the beach it featured 1 foot high piles of stinking sea vegetation, the sand is full of cigarette filters, beer bottle capsules and even some used condoms. Homeless have settled underneath the pergolas. Forget the romantic walk on sun down. Past the multi-lingual beggars and the pot smokers you have to fight a myriad of flies.</td></tr>

I even called to confirm the room because I knew we would be arriving after 4pm, at that time I requested a room close to the elevator because I was having knee issues. I was told there was no problem. When we arrived I was told the room I had reserved was not available, even though I had called to confirm earlier in the day. All they had was a king corner room. I showed the agent my confirmation for a king room with a sofa, (we prefer not to sit on the bed due to back issues), she told me that it was just a request and not a guarantee. She also said I was lucky to even have a room because they were booked up with a basketball tournament and two weddings. One of the elevators was out of service and it took forever to get to our room or to the lobby all weekend. The other elevators had wet floors every single time we got in them. I know that is to be expected when there is a pool, but it was a dangerous situation. Our room, being a corner room, was the very last room at the end of the hall. The light bulb in the bathroom was out, we had to call maintenance to have it fixed. We went to the lounge to have a drink and it was over flowing. There was no policing of the lounge. There was one person staying on the floor that brought an entire basketball team in the lounge and was proud of the fact that they had gotten away with it. So of course there was no soda or water left in the fridge and no snacks to be found. It was also impossible to get a glass of wine or beer as the attendant was nowhere to be found. The scene was the same if not worse in the morning for breakfast, it was a mess, and there was nothing to eat except some bread for the toaster and clumpy oatmeal. There was no silverware or plates or glasses and as each player left the coach was reminding them to take two or three drinks for later. It was extremely frustrating as a paying guest to not be able to use the amenities I paid for.</td></tr>

I spoke promptly with the front desk and assured them no great harm was done, but that I wanted the mattress replaced. The staff promised to replace the mattress, and when I returned to the hotel 8 hours later, the spring was gone and the sheets had been changed. I went to bed on the second night only to wake up and be scratched by a different spring. Assuming this wasn't a second defective mattress, the hotel clipped the first spring and left me with the same damaged mattress.

My family really enjoyed being able to watch the planes leave and arrive to the airport. The front desk staff was very accomodating in getting us an adjoining room, The only negative experience I had during my stay was upon check-in. At check-in there was a long line and four people behind the desk however, only two were checking in guests. I have worked in the hospitality industry before so I understand shift changes however, a courtesy "we will be right with you" or "thank you for your patience" would have gone a long way. To ignore the line of people waiting without soe acknowledgement does not embrace customer service.</td></tr>

I made use of the Fitness Center which offers a good choice of equipment and we were upgraded to the Lounge level where I enjoyed the rooftop garden and the amenities of the Lounge on a daily basis. The room was well appointed with a flat screen tv, comfy chair, a desk and chair and an armoire with a safe. The bathroom was pristine with a contemporary flair. The location was not ideal for theatre, museums or Central Park, but I had such a great experience that I would probably stay here again and make the commute!</td></tr>

There is a quiet adult pool and a much larger family pool area with water slides and water features. Overall, the front desk and valet staff were very professional, welcoming, and accommodating. The rooms are spare and somewhat small, although I expected this based on website pictures and other reviews. However, I was surprised how generally banged up all the furniture was. The room was clean, but all the scratches and dents made it seem less so. The bath is very basic, with no upgraded finishes, but it served its purpose. The mattress was comfortable. Note: partial ocean view was quite removed from the sound/smell of the waves because this is a very large property. Note: if you're not a super-attractive 40's mother or one of her beautiful daughters, save yourself the money for surf/paddle board instruction from the gruff old teacher. He and his staff pay plenty of attention to such travelers (while providing their off-color commentary while the women are out of hearing range). Everyone else gets the short end of the stick. Overall, this place serves the purpose well for someone wanting full access to the sights, sounds, and nightlife of Waikiki, with a comfortable place to rest their head at night.</td></tr>

In the past I have worked with the sales and conference staff and they always went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect.

Its not the best or newest of hotels but its suited my business needs until my last experience. I arrived at the hotel at 10pm after coming in from London via Boston. Went to check in but was told the room wasnt available as it hadnt been cleaned. Receptionist said that it would take 30 to 60 minutes. I wasnt happy but these things happen occasionally so I was prepared to live with this if it wasnt going to take more than an hour and I told the reception this. It got to midnight and no one had spoken to me and there was a large line building in reception: i wasnt alone. Lined up for nearly 40 minutes. At around 1am, the reception said that they were not able to provide me with a room (along with about 20 other guests) but they had organised a room at a motel. They provided me with $40 for cab fare. This motel was about 30 mintues (at 1am mind you) out of baltimore and cost $55. It took another hour to get checked in as there were many other people from the Belvoir there. Got a room and the condition of this room was unbelievable. Lock on the door didnt work, stains on nearly every fabric of the room and basically I didnt feel safe. I got to bed at around 3am but had to be back at the Belvoir for a car to pick me up at 7am. Total nightmare. I cant believe this is a Belvoir Hotel. I've never experienced this at a hotel of this alleged level. The staff were doing the best they could but there appeared to be no one in charge: management of the situation was severely lacking. I go to Baltimore regularly and luckily I have some choice where I stay. In conclusion...1. I wont be going back to this hotel; and 2. I will be recommending to my company to remove this hotel from the preferred list. For a business traveller (and any traveller/guest) the experience was unacceptable.</td></tr>

I received a very disinterested reaction from Guest Services when I complained about the loss of a major section of the hotel's facilities, especially important after a long hot day. The only response was to use the lap pool at the Swan which, as a result, was overcrowded and dirty. I wouldn't mind the loss of a major portion of the hotel's facility if we were compensated in some manner. But no, we were offered nothing, and I was not contacted by Guest Services management as I had requested.</td></tr>

Then, he proceeded into the room and stood about 12 inches away from the desk I was working on. I told him it might take a while and asked he he had to be in the room while I used the screw driver and he said yes "because he needed to use it." When I realized I was going to need to call my company help desk, I closed the laptop back up and told him this was not going to work. I would suggest that the hotel mgt might investigate having a few basic tools on hand for guest that need them which would avoid the need and expense of having employees stand around and supervise the use of a pocket screwdriver that costs less than picking up the phone and dialing a "free" 800 number from the hotel. Otherwise, service was outstanding, however, this incident marred my visit.</td></tr>

The free shuttle was the most convenient part of our stay as it alleviated the stress of parking and traffic at the hospital.

This resulted in confusion for some of our group and renting the suite was a waste of time and money. Also, had requested a microwave in the room upon arrival but when we checked in we were told that they did not provide micorwaves.

Wrong, this club lounge is not "keyed" so there is no water or soda available off hours from the breakfast or evening social.

However, the disparity in of service received at the various properties needs focus. I might as well had walked in off the street and begged for a room at this hotel. First of all, upon checking in I was told there were no upgrades available and I would be required to stay on a low floor with zero view. Fine. Not a big deal. However, my floor was on a separate elevator bank than the lounge. So I had to travel all the way down and back up to go to the lounge. Not a huge deal, but you would think they could accommodate me on the same set of floors with a common elevator bank. Secondly, the TV did not work well in my room (the picture was fuzzy). I told the desk, but it was never fixed. In addition, my room was conveniently located near the elevator and across from the ice machine to make for a very noisy background and it looked like every room on the floor had a paper in front of their door in the morning except my room. The final kicker was when it started to rain and I had to run out for a meeting. I called guest services and the Concierge to get an umbrella. Apparently there was not a single umbrella in the hotel to lend to a platinum guest. Maybe someone should be sent out to buy a dozen for a rainy day. Good idea? None of these items are a big deal in the large scope of things, but this lack of small services is a far cry from the type of attention paid to valuable customers at other properties.</td></tr>

The sliding door barely able to open and rattled at the slightest wind. Carpet was dirty. Chrome was worn off bathroom fixtures. The list is endless... As a gold member, not to mention the fact that I converted American Express points to Starpoints to facilitate my stay (at 3 Amex points to 1 Starpoint!)

We would like to suggest adult hours for the pool. As late as 9:40 PM, adults could not even have a conversation by the pool because there were so many screaming, splashing children. I know this is not the hotel's fault, but adult-only hours could help to alleviate this problem. I also know we were not the only ones affected by this since others in the elevator discussed their leaving for the same reason. The morning we left, we needed a cab just before 7 AM. No one was outside except a member of the cleaning crew. He kindly stopped and asked if we needed a cab. He then whistled for one and refused to take a tip.

Because of the layout of the hotel any room that faced the pool had an echoing effect to anyone who was in the pool or on their balcony's that would keep you up all night. The rooms had very little soundproofing. I could hear my neighbors conversations. I've stayed in hotels half the price that provided refrigerators in the rooms, a full complimentary breakfast and quiet rooms.</td></tr>

However, this particular property falls short of most if not all Belvoir standards. From exterior appearance to in-room temperature control, this facility falls well below BPG Category 2 standards and likely does not deserve to be branded with the Belvoir name. Multiple back-to-back stays point to an under-trained staff that fails to do what they say they're going to do by when they say they're going to do it. Still, for the price point associated with early booking, this property is generally a good value. It is great for Safeway corporate guests, and great for access to Stoneridge Mall.</td></tr>

Within walking distance to an amazing mall with food and entertainment. It is in a wooded area that is beautiful. Our room was in the lodge section, which is set in the woods further. The parking was free which is an added benefit. The unfortunate problem was that there wasn't a ramp, an incline to pull your luggage up or for handicap assistance that we could find. And your rooms are either downstairs or upstairs, ours' was downstairs and there isn't an elevator in the lodge (I checked with the front desk) and it is very inconvenient to lug your luggage up and down steps!! Our room was enormous and near the laundry, a big plus! It was beautiful with an huge desk and full size sleeper sofa, beautifully furnished. Yet another problem was that in our bathroom (room 166) there was only hot, very hot water in the tub/shower. I complained to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer down to fix it while we were gone for the day. We had 3 nights total stay (May 25th-27th and 27th-28th, 2 different bookings using cash and points but all in the same room), the engineer never showed up during our stay. And due to no elevator and ramp, it was difficult to change rooms. At checkout, after several tries to get all my receipts, I was almost offered a free breakfast, I was asked if I ate, but I was on my way to my flight and had no time, I think the front desk was going to offer me a meal but I'll never know. As beautiful as it was, and as close of a location to family as it was, it had it's draw backs.</td></tr>

I never received a phone call, and later that evening when we returned to the hotel, I had to re-explain the situation to the front desk staff to claim our rooms. After receiving our new room keys, our group went back to our single temporary room to gather our belongings, except our key cards no longer worked and someone else was in the room.

The Downtown Belvoir satifies the highest standards a traveler like myself requires. They offer great accomodations, excellent food, phenominal service. The staff, from the parking garage through the wait staff, to everyone you encounter on the property is wonderfully friendly and helpful. I will not consider another location when I am in the Philadelphia area.</td></tr>

Location: ideal. Front desk folks: consistently helpful. Room: clean and comfortable. (Fave part: instant hot water in the shower.) Restaurant: surprisingly tasty. Lobby bar: late night gem with amazing food. Small quibbles: TV had poor reception, both beds rocked/shifted, and $2 charge for in-room bottled water (at room temperature!).</td></tr>

The hotel is convenient to the airport and the shuttle driver was very friendly and professional. However, the front desk attendant was unfriendly upon check in. I asked what my breakfast options were for the next morning, since each hotel is different with the platinum benefit. He told me I wasn't platinum in a condescending tone. The whole conversation was generally condescending and unfriendly. I corrected him and resolved the situation, but the manner he spoke to me in at first was very unprofessional and unnecessary. The room was okay. I was traveling with my girlfriend and two others and shared just one room. The beds are tiny for two people, just double beds. The layout of the room and bathroom was a little odd, but it was clean and good size. For breakfast we ate in the Belvoir Club. In one word, awful. The quality and selection was poor. (1 picked over fruit plate, a few pieces of bread/bagels for toast, and some dry scrambled eggs). The attendant was uninterested and was watching the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and later the a special on Soul Train on the Club's TV during breakfast service. The service we received was just not acceptable. I think the hotel has a lot of potential because the overall property is nice, but the service was not anywhere near Grandbourne's standard.</td></tr>

For so long I missed having an BPG hotel in Stamford. This hotel opened up and it has surpassed anything I could have expected. The staff is exceptional. From the front desk to the Club Lounge hostess, the janitorial staff, the employees you meet in the hallway. Everyone was warm, friendly, smiling. We were checking out, my five year old son had a frown, and the front desk attendant ( how could I have forgotten her name!) stopped what she was doing to inquire what was wrong. He told her he was hungry, and she went and got him a snack! By the way, the wait staff at the restaurant is great! Definitely will stay there again. I stayed in a suite, and it was bigger than a NYC apartment.</td></tr>
