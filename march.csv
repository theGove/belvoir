When I got to my room I found that my pillow case was dirty the first and then didn't get changed the for second night. I could not enjoy a bath because the tub had a stain ( the newly remodeled room). The second night I was there I had to call house keeping to come change my sheets and no one was sent up. That same night I waited in the DRAFT to place a togo order and had to ask someone to wait on me.

I have reserved two rooms in this Hotel, two weeks before our arrival to see the Miami game with the following (two connected rooms one with King Bed and the other room with two queen-sized bed for our friends children. On the day of our arrival in Miami around noon I called the hotel to let them know that we will be checking in by 4:00pm, the staff that answered the phone assured me that the two rooms weve reserved are ready and will be waiting for us. But then, when we got there, a lady from the registration desk told us that only one room is ready and that the second room (connected to one room) should soon be ready so she gave us the keys for only one room. After about 30 minutes I called the front desk to see if the second room is ready, another lady talked to me with a different tone on her voice and said the room will not be ready for another 30 to 45 minutes, I was very unsatisfied at that moment so I asked her why then she said there is nothing she can do the guest that was staying on that room had checked out late so their just starting to clean the room. After 20 minutes my husband came out the room and so the cleaning lady just got done cleaning it so my friend went downstairs, and a guy said that the room is not ready and it should be ready by the time we get back from the game so she went back to the room .Ive asked my husband to come with me down the front desk to talk to a manager about the whole thing. When we asked for a manager a Supervisor offered to talk to us and shell try to help us she said. We told her exactly what was happening and that we are very dissatisfied of all the staff that we talked to she apologized and asked us what she could do to ease our disappointment so we asked her to find if the room is ready and that because of all the delay that we should also have a late check out. She asked us what time we want to check out and we said 6:00pm if thats possible she said yes and she also said the room is ready but, there are no 2 queen beds in any of the rooms, but they can and will provide us a bed (a folding bed which by the way, my friends back ached so bad the next day). So that was the end of our first day, The next day on our way to eat breakfast, I went to front desk just to make sure that we are checking out at 6:00pm, what a surprise when the lady I was talking said it was not entered into the system at all, that if we had checked out at six they would charge us a full day extra. Thank God I went back to check before it was too late. So everything is set, we went out,came back around 5pm , guess what? We were locked out! Our keys were not reprogrammed to check out by 6pm so my husband went down to the front desk wanted to talk to the manager once and for all. But the lady he was talking to giving him more excuses for what happened instead of calling the manager so my husband just had enough , he just asked the keys to be reprogrammed. Overall, we had a great time in Miami except for the services that weve had from this hotel and made us all feel not to come and check in to any Belvoir hotel ever."

Then my dogs were up and awake, four hours later we were awakened by the walls viberating and making a really loud noise. This continued until we left the room on and off every 15 mins or so till 10am. We then gave up on sleeping and dealing with the dogs growling at 7am and decided to shower. We then had very hot- to freezing temp water in the shower, the temp changed alot for me and my husband then showered and his shower was freezing the entire time. We called and spoke with a girl and she said she would get us a room change as soon as she can figure out a room for us to move to. We waited for a phone call back about a room being ready and never got one. So when we left the room for the day we stopped at the front desk to speak with someone and a manager I think said when we came back later that evening he would have a room ready for us, and would give 2000 rewards points in addition to our stay for the inconvience. This was fine I understand problems happen and that would be fine if they fixed the issue. We then came back at the end of the day around 9pm and there was no room ready so we stood in the lobby waiting to move. No notes in the system to move us, or of the issue, or anything. We finally got another room, went to get our things to move to the next room and got in to bed. We made it to 9am before the noise started in this room so that was good, but the shower was still terrible. I did not enjoy a second cold shower. I called the guest service and they told me they would have a manager call me back within 30 mins. No one called me back and I was there till 12. I also had the note on the door saying quiet and I had a housekeeper try to come into the room from 10am on till I left.

Well that simple nights stay was a bit less than simple. Firstly the room location was out of the way up a few stairs and a bit confusing as to its location not being part of the tower. Upon entering the room, the toilet was running, simple enough just jiggle the handle and it stopped. The internet wasn't nearly a strong enough signal for what it cost. It took nearly 15 minutes of trying to connect to the network before giving up and using a smartphone. On a side note, in this day and age many of your competitors offer wi-fi free of charge for their guests. The coffee machine was difficult to turn on requiring quite a bit of force to turn on. In addition to the force required to turn on the coffee maker one had to also brace the machine to prevent it from being knocked over by the force to turn in on. this is both dangerous and unneeded in my opinion."

Their evening snacks were very nice- hot meatballs, poppers, chicken kabobs, etc. (2 different ones every night). Our third night here we switched to a suite because we were excpeting another person and needed more room. I called down to request a rollaway in the suite. They called me back a few minutes later and told me they only give rollaways to the suites. I had to tell them that I was in a suite. I'm not sure why they didn't already know this! Then a few minutes later they called me back and told me they had no rollaways available and offered to send up extra blankets instead. Then later that night the front dest called me and asked me if I got my rollaway. I had to inform them that they told me they had none. So, they were a little disjointed on communication between the front desk and the service people. We had upgrated to the suite for the rollaway and then didn't get one. So we were alittle squichy on the beds that night. Other than that the beds were comfortable."

The concierge had a long list of recommended activities and restaurants that we took use of. The hotel is on the beach and the Hawaiian ice truck across the street is not to be missed. We were glad we had our car to go to the main part of the city in the evenings. We found parking very easy and the two times we paid was cheap. I think trying to use the shuttle with 5 people would have been hard. We all had a blast - my kids are 3, 7, and 9 and they LOVED Key West. The hotel was a great place for us.
